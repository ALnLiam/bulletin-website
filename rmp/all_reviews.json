Cameras had to follow his exact guidelines (show face, hands, and exam paper at all times) during exams would flag students. It made me highly anxious. He did not care even when you are sick and need extra help/extensions.",

The tests are online, but include many niche 'trivia-like' questions from the notes, so be sure to study the slides and know them well.

She gives incorrect grading sheets to TA's so it's impossible to get a good grade unless u correct her thru email. Any question u have, expect a 1 or 2 word vague incorrect answer.",

I was not knowing much about computer science, but his course helped me so much on understanding major concepts of it along with very practical coding practices. Prof Foder is very helpful and patient with students. Take his courses! Highly recommended!",

He also loves trick questions, and you'll encounter many in both tests and lectures. His lectures are helpful if you go into them having already skimmed the textbook and practiced a bit.",

Course has little more mathematics. But he warns about the mathematics in very first class. Also he is very approachable and clear all your doubts. Very Student friendly teacher",

Lectures tend to not be very helpful, and his attitude during them is often off-putting and condescending. On the bright side, homework is worth more of your grade than any singular exam is (which is helpful), and the curve is rather generous.",

He tries to explain but the combination of the accent + being unsure how to solve the questions himself do not help. Homework is 40% of the grade so do it and do it well.

You will learn a lot from the class, but not from him. He's also very monotonic, you will not pay attention, but attendance is mandatory.  Honestly, it's an easy A class regardless.",

So if you miss or don't understand the student's answer, you are missing this key point. and also, the slide is brief and rough, a lot of details she just mentioned a little in class, but will be included exam",

    "Comment": "Although the course was interesting and he did not bore us in class. In the presentations he gave everyone full marks without evaluating the clarity and coherency of the speakers, this led to a very skewed curve and most of the students ended up getting A- even if they had a 90+ aggregate. He added a 10% bonus on the project but that was of no use",

His assignments where dry and poorly explained. Test consisted of the usual multiple choice that are intended to trick you. Sure he may be nice, but don't let that fool you.",

His content is copied from various AI lecture slides of other universities and he doesn't explain things in class, pushing questions on stack saying \"I'll come to it later\".

Home works are not hard if hard questions are present they are not graded. In the beginning I could not catch up with his lectures but I could do it in as course progressed.",

True, he has an accent that may be a little tough to swallow, but you should get used to it in time.  I certainly wouldn't mind taking another class with him.",

He knows his compsci though, and he makes the stuff learnable, if not particularly easy. He's also much more open to students than most people believe; they just don't approach him enough. His tests are pretty hard though, so STUDY!",

Attendance isn't even mandatory, so even if you have problems and can't work it out with him, you really don't have to go to class. Tries to be funny, so that's always a plus. Really if u study the material, u should be fine. Tests and assignments are tricky, be careful.",

In Fall 05 when I had him he nearly canceled a class because someone's cell phone rang twice. But his frustration is understandable since no one's phone should be going off during lecture anyway. He is a fair grader; he curves a lot on his exams.",

      "I took his class during COVID. He was very strict with grading and was always assuming that we were cheating during exams. Cameras had to follow his exact guidelines (show face, hands, and exam paper at all times) during exams would flag students. It made me highly anxious. He did not care even when you are sick and need extra help/extensions.",
      "Records all lectures; gives many examples that illustrates lecture content (code snippets); great prof, would recommend for any course!",
      "Kane structures his class very well, but it tends to be heavily based on lectures and live-coding examples. The tests are online, but include many niche 'trivia-like' questions from the notes, so be sure to study the slides and know them well. Always start HW early because the assignments can take a while.",
      "Professor Kane is the GOAT. As long as you follow along in lectures and start the work early, you should be good for the class. If I didn't procrastinate my work for this class, probably could've done better :(",
      "Kane explains the lecture material fairly well, although his lectures aren't the most enthralling. Exams are pretty fair and he let us bring in cheat sheets. Lectures are also recorded. Haven't spoken to him much but he seems pretty chill (although I might be biased cause he reminds me of my dad).",
      "i took 316 with him and he's an amazing professor. not only does he teach the material really well, he's also very down to earth and understands you. is also very lenient and steps in to help when asked. his TAs are also pretty good. class wasn't curved but i guess it doesn't really need to be. do the work and it should be an A.",
      "The professor was very good at explaining (though his handwriting was very hard to understand), and his slides give you all you need for the exams, which always had simple questions. The only issue was the homework, writing all the proofs out took hours.",
      "Kane is a gem of a professor. He teaches the material very well with informative slides and homework examples. He gives extra credit (which isn't necessary to get an A) and answers quickly with Piazza. He also records the lectures, so don't feel pressured to go to every class. Only reason he's not a 5 is because his lectures are very monotonous.",
      "The best professor you could have for CSE 215.",
      "IAE 101 with Professor Kane and Graham was a really interesting class. The content can sometimes be challenging especially for people without prior programming experience.",
      "Professor Kane is literally the goat! He gave a lot of extra credit and although some of the hws were a pain, they were definitely manageable. Exams were fair and they were graded leniently. He's also really understanding and does what he can to accommodate for all his students. Definitely one of the best for CSE 215, you won't regret it!",
      "If you have to take cse215, take Professor Kane. He does give a lot of homework and they do take a long time to complete, but they will help you the most in passing the exams. In this class, doing practice problems will really help you. He gives practice exams but they're not that similar to the actual tests but still do them! And attend lectures!",
      "Professor Kane was very interactive and an overall a gem of a professor for CSE 215. The course itself wasnt too bad, which I would say that as long as homework was completed, youd be set of an average of A- and higher. The questions on his exams are similar to content on his homework assignments.",
      "He is a great professor. His 331 exams were not that difficult compared to CSE 310. His lectures are very interesting and he really enjoys the topic (you can see it). You should really go to his lectures, since he doesn't mention stuff that are not on the slides and are part of the exam. Overall great professor for security related classes.",
      "Attend the lectures. He basically gives you a model for your work so you can follow. Attend office hours and you'll be able to understand what to do for the work he assigns.",
      "If you actually attend his class, it is the best class to take. He sticks to the point rather than saying stories, answers every question you could possibly have, and goes far and beyond to help you whether it is answer a million questions or giving week long extensions for all the homeworks. I would definitely take another class with him.",
      "He really deserves a better score. He is so patient and replies to emails in great detail.",
      "Do not take this class just for SBC credit because there is too much material for it to be a 101 class. Don't make the same mistake that I did because you won't have enough time for other classes. This class is very time-consuming.",
      "IF YOU ARE A NOVICE AT COMPUTER SCIENCE, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I know it says its a 101 course, but this class is difficult. If you need the SBC, pick something else, its not worth it. One day you're experimenting with simple strings and functions, the next you're making a blackjack simulator. Not sure if I'm going to pass honestly.",
      "This Digital intelligence class is by far the worst class I have ever taken in my life, in a class of roughly 300 roughly 10 to 15 students understand the material, however they are computer science majors. This class is so difficult with the assignments given with the time given for each. Absurd class and the teaching is not clear cut",
      "I took CSE307 and CSE310 with him. One of the best profs. in Stony Brook. Take him not for an easy A, but if you want to learn material. He explains topic in very organized and interesting manner. Also, prof Kane was the only professor who was able to handle rest of semester organized and cared about students after shifting to online lectures.",
      "Here's the thing  for a 101 class, IAE is challenging and very difficult. Especially for this who have no programming experience. However, if you go see Kane during office hours or even email him, he is extremely helpful and responds almost instantly. Yes, it's tough, but you get a lot of support as well.",
      "Prof. Kane deserves a better review score. His assignments and exams are fair. Easy to approach after class. I can't speak for IAE, but for CSE310 he definitely has already done his best as his first time teaching this course.",
      "Here's the thing  IAE 101 is supposed to be an intro to coding class. It isn't! Professor Kane moves fast and you must understand the material to advance through the assignments given. Therefore, if you are planning to take this course, I recommend that you are at least somewhat familiar with coding (Python or not). Kane is ok.",
      "This professor was one of the worst Ive ever taken. Taking him my first semester in school completely threw off my views and motivations. He expects 101 students to know coding at a level completely above that. I attended all the classes, and was still lost because he completely pulls his projects out of no where. Do not take.",
      "For a 101 class, the coursework was beyond difficult. Prof. Graham's insightful, well developed, and enrapturing lectures were all that kept me from dropping. Prof. Kane is a knowledgeable man with no idea how to teach coding and programming to beginners and it shows. If you are a true novice to CS, I absolutely wouldn't recommend this course.",
      "Gives so much homework and is not clear on grading criteria.",
      "Prof. Kane will give you help if you need it. Attendance wasn't required, and if you're experienced at programming, you can pass the course by studying it on your own. Dr. Kane grades reasonably and applied a small curve. My only complaint is that he can be too repetitive at times. You'll also need to be open to learning new languages like Perl."

      "No curve, run...",
      "The good thing was she gave extra credits on every exams. Love it.",
      "If you attend the class, you will pass relatively easy.",
      "Why is everyone whining so much? Not an easy prof, but def a fair one. AS IN: If you study, you will pass, if you don't study you won't pass. It's not CSE300. Deal with it. \n\nI came away from this course actually learning something.",
      "The professor herself sometimes feels confused about questions she came up with. She has more than 10 quizzes and is very tough on grading homework. The content of cse310 is too much and you need approximately more than 15 hours per week to fully understand them. Terrible experience having classes with her.",
      "it is tough to get high score. almost every week we have a quiz. there is no sample before exam. she will give you a lot of resources to review. a lot of stuff. very tough",
      "the worst professor in my life",
      "Professor Hoblos is an excellent teacher who truly cares about her students. Her explanations in class are clear, and she's always available to help during office hours. She made complex topics much easier to understand by going through examples in class and giving us practice questions to study. Make sure you put the effort in.",
      "Absolutely do not take this class or any of her other classes. This professor is genuinely the least understanding and one of the most rude people I've ever met. Yells at people for getting up for the bathroom during an 80 minute lecture. Gives the TA's incorrect grading sheet almost always resulting in lower grades.",
      "Absolute worst introductory professor I've ever had the misfortune of encountering. She has anger issues and ONLY reads off slides. I get its a lecture, but the class can be taught so much better and the fact that she's not a good person in general doesn't help. Avoid this joke. Take my goat, Kevin McDonnell. He's chill and ACTUALLY TEACHES.",
      "Y'all already read the reviews. Don't take this class (not with her at least). I'm currently a sophomore and taking this class with her first sem freshman year has tanked my gpa and has been so hard to bring back up. I came back to warn y'all. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Good luck loves :,O",
      "She genuinely does not want u to succeed. I took her for 114 & 310. She's not organized, heavy accent, rude, & doesn't know the subject. She cannot teach a 101 class. She gives incorrect grading sheets to TA's so it's impossible to get a good grade unless u correct her thru email. Any question u have, expect a 1 or 2 word vague incorrect answer.",
      "Half of student fail her class and it's required for major...the grading is so harsh, especially for the exam which many did worse than they thought and it's 30% of the grade. No curve whatsoever and harsh grading for homework. Ruined my gpa and got my first C. If you can wait for diff prof, please do for your own good.",
      "She wants you to fail, like she definitely decided to become a professor to drift kids away from her field.",
      "Hoblos brings a middle-school vibe to a college environment. She always assumes the worst in students and constantly talks badly to them, AND doesn't teach well at all. The class is easy, since she posts all the needed modules (made by McDonnell, not her) and you get extra credit opportunities, but her demeanor singlehandedly makes it a bad class.",
      "A lot of people tend to skip the lectures and resort to the online recordings. I did this in the beginning of the semester and I dealt with the repercussions. But when you attend in person she is a good instructor, she asks if anyone has any questions. She is a very fair professor, she offered my class extra credit to help boost our grades.",
      "This class was boring. Instead of actually lecturing she just goes over modules made by someone else. If you want to try and get into Computer Science and see if it's for you, this isn't the class. The work wasn't exactly hard but was extremely boring. They give a lot of extra credit options if you're doing bad though. Hated this class still.",
      "Even if you start with the knowledge of all these subjects, you will see the feeling of lying in the guillotine. Be prepared for D or lower if you think you are average.",
      "Worse professor I've ever had at Stonybrook.",
      "Absolute horrid professor who uses slides from the textbook for lectures. She doesn't return any midterms which usually contain content she hasn't taught. Would avoid!",
      "Let me be clear, I got an A- bc of the TAs and self-studying. She cannot teach. She just goes through her slides and hopes u dont ask a question. She is incredibly rude and does not take kindly questions or comments. She has anger issues and will throw a fit. Its one thing to be a bad teacher, its another to be a bad person and a bad teacher.",
      "I had the worst time taking this INTRODUCTORY course. The subject wasn't difficult but she is a harsh grader. She doesn't take questions lightly, whether in class or during exams. She gets upset if someone walks in late and threatens to kick them out. She gets upset if she is corrected. She relies on her assistants to teach material.",
      "Prof gives no feedback, rely on your TA's. She does not return midterms, nor does she prep you for them or the final. She may seem like she cares, but she doesnt really. She will take away points because she doesnt even like your handwriting. If you make mistakes and try and fix them, too bad she doesnt care. For whoever has her, I pray for you.",
      "She is a horrible professor. She does not curve the class at all which is unheard of for a very challenging class. I think there is a language barrier between her and the students so we can't understand anything from her lectures.",
      "if you care about your grades, stay away from here! exams too hard, compare to how and what she teaches. Does not know what is happening in her class and leaves everything to TAs!! Also, has anger issues and she never wants to admits that she does not know something or she's wrong",
      "Let me be real with everyone. This rating comes from her prior college, Penn State. She sucks. For me she taught CS 122, a very easy class, but managed to make it diffult with 3 things: impossible questions, poorly made quizzes and exam see, and 0 responsibility in terms of responding to students and justifying grading decisions. Sorry Stoney...",
      "She's okay as a person but awful as a professor. She is not good at explaining the concepts and you have to self-study. It is easy to get frustrated in this class and quit unless you are interested in coding already. You shouldn't expect this class to be inspiring or fun. No chance of getting support, but chance of getting an F.",
      "One of the worst professors I have taken at SBU. Lectures aren't helpful and she gives hw last minute when the semester is about to end. Stay away if possible!!!",
      "She would assign homework at inconvenient times (i.e.making them due the last day of the break) was unhelpful, much of her slides are taken straight off of the internet. Snarky and someone who wanted her students to suffer. 42% of her students get less than a C, half of those students getting an F. Very rude teacher, never take her classes, please.",
      "Loved this teacher! I will forever remember her classes!"

      "I've never taken this man's class or attended this college, but I found his lectures online and they are straight fire. I wish my discrete math teacher had the knowledge and enthusiasm that are conveyed by these lecture slides. I don't know him and probably never will, however, let the record state that he is appreciated.",
      "ganapathi seems to lack a basic understanding of how education works. many questions on exams cover material not once mentioned between all lectures and practice materials. even so, the material he does teach is often times so poorly constructed and unnecessarily convoluted you'd have a hard time completing relevant exam questions.",
      "Practice tests have no answers, TAs and Professors do not respond to emails nor help, exams are at least 50% surprise concepts, formatting docks you lots of points and it's never made clear to you, homework is a nightmare, averages are never above 80%. Worth switching schools to avoid. Would rather pass a kidney stone than take this again.",
      "didnt wear seatbelt while driving to class because i hoped i would crash on the way",
      "very hard homework and tests, need to spend a lot of time on his subject, overcomplicated a lot of materials",
      "Avoid this guy like the bubonic plague.",
      "IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE TEACHING THE CLASS TAKE IT WITH THEM. I cannot overstate how unreasonable this man is. There is nothing he won't do to give you less points on a homework or exam. I also cannot overstate how absolutely useless the TAs are. Unable to explain any problems. Are often not at office hours/very late and are hard to contact.",
      "Despite what others say, I enjoyed Prof. Ganapathi's class. He wants students to succeed, but also wants to properly teach them. He clearly has a strong passion for puzzles, logic, and discrete mathematics, which made the lectures much more enjoyable and engaging. The tests can be challenging, but many problems were based directly from the slides.",
      "Midterms are very hard. Homeworks are graded strictly too. Good teacher, but a bad professor. Please choose another professor for CSE 215",
      "He requires the work to be formatted in a certain way but never mentions it , more than it needs to be. The content is useful, but he could provide more useful practice problems that are more relevant to the exams.",
      "Although he is nice, he is not a great professor. He doesn't explain anything properly. Take another professor for 215.",
      "Arguably the worst cs professor at Stony. He can not teach at all. Avoid him at all costs.",
      "If you ask how to simplify a logical expression, he'll say use the properties in the slides (gives the bare minimum of details) to figure it out and to learn it as if he isn't the teacher who's supposed to be teaching it. It's baffling how he just says think and hasn't not writing anything on the board to teach. He overcomplicated an easy subject.",
      "attendance not mandatory, give practice midterms, a lot of homework but it really helps to understand the material",
      "amazing person, but bad professor.",
      "terrible teacher. too much homework. He said four hw in total. But it has 5 already. unnecessary complicate. midterm taken online but not enough time. very strict on the submission time...even though there is internet issues...the worst professor ever....",
      "Had him for 214, 215, and 373. Man's the goat!",
      "Professor Ganapathi definitely deserve more than a 1.9. He has amazing lectures and the explanation of concept is very straight forward. His exams are conceptual so understanding the material is more important than just memorizing.",
      "Pramod can deserve more than 1.9 for cse 215. Honestly, he should get 3.0 above. His lecture slides are very useful and clear. Even, I don't need to go to class(since I always get lost when attending his lecture. I dont know why....). Besides, exams/questions of each semester are various, but the ways to solve them are highly similar or are same.",
      "unnecessarily complicated. If you can try your best to avoid this class.",
      "F ganapathi, he didn't curve the grades at all. Worst teacher of all stonybrook. Don't take this course.",
      "Ganapathi is very caring and wants you to succeed in life, not only in school. He also takes feedback to heart and always listens to his students. The course is very organized and the expectations are clear. I would definitely recommend him!",
      "Takes great feedback from his students. I highly recommend him!",
      "Ganapathi was an excellent professor for CSE 215! Very organized with his lecture slides, lectures, and homework assignments werent too difficult! Would definitely say he deserves better than an 1.8 on RMP..",
      "Pretty nice class. Really hard though.",
      "Though the course was hard, Ganapathi was truly an inspirational speaker. He motivated me to learn this hard subject .",
      "He's fine. I think he deserves more rates than 1.5",
      "The class is fine, but there are just really dumb policies that tick me off. Despite showing proof that I had issues with uploading during an exam, I still lost a lot of credit for submitting 2 minutes late. So hope you guys have good internet. He is very passionate about the subject though, and his lecture about career development was helpful.",
      "I felt Ganapathi does not explain concepts well but tries very hard to help you. The midterms were not incredibly difficult and he told us what topics to expect on the exams. The homework was harder than the exams and long. I strongly suggest reading the textbook or watching other resources in order to understand the topics.",
      "Ganapathi is passionate about discrete math, but he expects his students to share in both his love of math and his proficiency. Grading on the tests and HW is the toughest grading I've seen. Ganapathi expects way too much of his students, and you should not take this prof unless you are willing to make this class your number one priority in life."

      "He covered a calc 2 class for MY actual professor who was out sick. He speed-ran through the lecture and barely explained the concepts. The problems he solved on the board were a mess with multiple problems overlapping onto each other making it impossible to follow along. He uses many short cuts and does not explain the process of solving the math",
      "Lectures were never helpful as they had nothing to do with the homeworks or exams. Better to study lecture slides on your own than to waste time listening to nonsense. Multiple languages being covered that seemed like they were thrown together rather than one cohesive course. Grading took forever and was unclear. Worst professor at SBU.",
      "Jee is the most goated man to ever step foot on this Earth. I flopped every single exam. I diid wayyy below the average and was so sure I was going to get below a C and fall below 12 credits and get a financial aid warning. But then he saved me.",
      "His lectures are good but he sometimes has issues with accuracy and clarity on his notes. Do the HWs and do them well. By design of the class, his test averages are consistently around 50%. He makes up for this with heavily weighted HWs and a strong curve. He often makes mistakes, but is otherwise alright.",
      "Jee isn't a great teacher and the homeworks/exams in this class are very hard; they essentially test oddly specific and unnecessary implementations rather than your actual understanding of the concepts. Grading also takes forever, and instructions for assignments/exams tend to be vague and  confusing. The only good thing is the very generous curve.",
      "He will talk a lot to make it seem like he is giving a lot of useful information, but it's just a whole lot of nothing. You're better off not even going to class and just studying on your own. Homework from November was graded when classes ended and a week from finals which makes it impossible to even try to fix ur grades.",
      "So beautiful so elegant just looking like a wowow sums up this class",
      "Unbelievable professor who give people such a difficult exam (midterms) when we barely learned anything about the test, NEVER will there be any good practice tests. Absolutely awful. Also never respond to emails and questions.",
      "W professor. He gives sizeable curves. 11/10 Would take again!",
      "Professor Banerjee is great; definitely one of the better professors I had. He is humorous and down-to-earth, holds great lectures, and has great slides. The homework grading was somewhat of a mess, however, you could ask for a regrade and get it sorted out. Just go to this office hours or ask TA's for clarification, and you will be fine.",
      "The grading was a mess. Students waited several months for the grading and received ridiculous feedback while points are taken without reason. The grader didn't follow the rubric, instruction document, or even what they said when the assignment was once posted.",
      "Lectures heavy, so was test. little part of lectures on the Exams. \nSpend a whole semester learning Java Abstraction. Useless learning of Ocaml, I think we can just focus on Java and Python. He is not a tough grader. You can ask for regrade for all the hws. Which is still nice. I think the problems are the concept of this course. Not his false.",
      "Vague instructions, unfair exam questions, ill-prepared lectures. Spent hours memorizing stuff and they don't appear on the test lol.",
      "Prof. Banerjee gives out easy As if you do random chores for him around his house. I have no idea how to code but got top marks by vacuuming his rug or doing his laundry or washing his dishes after our date nights. He's such a silly goose, and loves spaghetti. Such a cutie during lectures, he's such a Sartorius. Great Prof, just remember he's MINE!",

      "HIs lectures are pretty good, but not necessary at attend with all the resources online. Most of the grade is based off of homeworks, which shouldn't be too hard if you paid attention to the lectures or equivalent. His biggest issue is that HOMEWORK NEVER GETS GRADED ON TIME. Exams are kind of tough, but count less than homeworks.",
      "Homework is never graded promptly like assignments are supposed to be. Final and Midterm averages are usually in the 40s. The homework will essentially save your grade in this class because the midterm/final are pretty hard.",
      "Always lates to class. Doesn't give much feedback. Lectures are not helping at all. At least it is not hard.",
      "Ritwik was consistently late regarding uploading homework assignments, lectures, grades(HW grades received after finals), and responding to emails. On the bright side he is one of the best lecturers I've had so far, but I rarely went to lectures since for all the topics covered there are lots of resources online. HWs/tests not bad and nice curve.",
      "The class was average, the first few tests were unusually hard compared to what we were taught, but over time they got easier. The only thing that was particularly bad was the fact that homework takes forever to be graded.",
      "Ritwik is by far the worst teacher I had encountered in possibly my entire schooling career. Expect him to take 2-3 days to respond to emails, and straight-up ignore your piazza posts. He consistently takes 1-2 months to grade each homework and exam. He has a lot of experience in Java, but I recommend you ditch his lectures and learn on your own.",
      "Pretty good lecturer, but I really wish he would post things on time. On multiple occasions he was days late in posting slides, lecture recordings, and homework. Oh, and he knows what pog means.",
      "Dr. Banerjee is one of the professors that pride themselves on being verbose, and inaccessible. This pandemic has changed education, but Banerjee doesn't even care enough to respond to emails. On our latest homework, he did not give clear instructions, and has made himself unavailable completely during the Thanksgiving break! Feels helpless!",
      "He is a terrible professor. He don't care about students. He is mean and selfish as a person. If you don't have a passion for teaching, just don't teach. He just make student life hard and miserable. He grade hw very late and hw are filled with errors.",
      "The lecture was very verbose, had a LOT of filler to filter out, & not enough examples to get the concepts of each lecture. HWs, even the 1st was the worst of the 5; it should be simplified. Even if he skipped JavaFX this semester, it was still hard to learn. He should take out some topics and take more time on teaching important parts first",
      "Absolutely terrible professor, homework solutions riddled with errors, slides riddled with typos, and incompetent grading TAs. One of the worst classes I've ever taken in my life. No clue why he's teaching. I feel bad for the people who tried to make this class less of a clown fiesta.",
      "The course material was pretty dry but the projects weren't too bad. Very little prep for the midterm and final (aside from TA's who were awesome). About 50% averages for both my semester which makes sense. Not that bad of a class overall though",
      "No idea what this class was supposed to actually teach. Terrible professor. Took months to get grades back on hw assignments and tests. HW docs are not specific, vague, and obviously rushed. Tests consist of a bunch of random questions about topics that were never covered in class. Acts like the lecture is his own personal TED talk.",
      "This is the worst CS professor I ever met. EXTREMELY Poor at explaining concepts. Gives terrible examples with weird variable names which will easily confuse you. Homework and recitation instructions are vague. Avoid taking his class as best as you can."

The exam is also very difficult mostly fill in the blanks",

No help for projects. Be prepared to struggl",

      "HE IS THE GOAT!!!",
      "Best prof you could get, just because the other options are so much worse in comparison. He records his lectures and his labs have flexible times so you basically build your own schedule. Bit of an accent and the labs did get ahead of lecture material sometimes but not too hard to figure out. The extra credit gave four entire points to your grade.",
      "He cares about his students and is always open to helping you out if you're struggling. He assigns a reasonable amount of homework and labs. You'll build a strong foundation of Java taking his class. Only reason my grade is low is cause I didn't apply myself in the beginning.",
      "FODOR THE GOAT!",
      "THE BEST PROFESSOR YOU CAN GET FOR THIS COURSE. Super caring about his students. Always says \"I want to help you\".",
      "Best professor to take 114 with, no doubt. Built a strong foundation in Java taking this course.",
      "Amazing proffessor",
      "tests are very easy and correspond to his lectures. He's also very understandable labs are not mandatory and all you have to do is submit the easy assignment. also offers an easy extra credit to boost your grade. final is not cumulative so you dont have to study many topics. Also records lectures.",
      "Fodor has taught over 16 different classes at SBU and if I could, I would have taken more. He has treated me with respect, is a consummate professional and  goes by his word. Although he has recently had a baby, he never cancelled our class and I never felt rushed when I asked a question/needed help. One of the best Prolog researchers in the world.",
      "Best CS prof",
      "Professor Fodor is not the worst but not the best I give him a poor rating because he does not respond to emails. He gives little curving from the cutoffs. He gives 10% on labs for 30 labs. Strict grader for exams worth 25% each and doesn't match practice sample and unfortunate for people who have huge anxiety and are not great test-takers.",
      "I love this professor. I was going through a really rough time mid-semester and ended the semester with a C in the class. Even though I got a C, Fodor is a great teacher that cares about his students and is willing to give extensions.",
      "Fodor is good at explaining and goes in-depth on the material. He uses slides, but he'll use other means too such as a chalkboard to demonstrate. Leaves room to ask questions in class, so while you can attend fully online if you want, it's better to be there to ask q's. Labs/hw can b tricky but not bad if you pay attention and study as fit!",
      "I took CSE316 with Professor Fodor, and it was an easy class. His lectures were sometimes too dry, but he was trying his best to keep everyone focused during each lecture. The assignments were not hard at all. You just do what you have to do, and you will pass with an A or A-.",
      "He's amazing! So helpful and caring!",
      "Professor Fodor is one of the best professors I ever met at the Stony Brook University (SBU). I used to take his CSE505-Computing with Logic and learned much knowledge and skills related to Prolog. I feel so lucky to take Prof. Fodor's course during my study at Stony Brook University.",
      "This was Fodor's first time teaching 316, a new-ish course, and I've heard of some problems with the McKenna sections beforehand. But there weren't any big problems. The work isn't bad and he's quick to get back to you if you have questions. He was also a god when it came to benefit of the doubt, extensions, and extra credit.",
      "One of Best professors in CS Major, he is really nice, friendly and easy to talk. You would not pass the class which has so great professor.",
      "He stepped in to take over the class the week before finals when our prof had to go on medical leave. He made the final exam extremely reasonable and did the best he could to teach us given the limited time we had left in the semester.",
      "I've taken 4 of Fodor's classes, and all of them are consistent in expectation, lecture style, and quizzes. Attendance is primarily enforced through quizzes, which serve more as a \"let's make sure you understand what we went over\" rather than a \"Gotcha!\" Tests are fair and the professor emphasizes learning and understanding.",
      "Professor Fodor is one of the best faculty I've acquainted with at Stony Brook University. When I was taking his course, he answered an extensive number of piazza questions so fast that initially, I thought the responses were automated(it wasn't!). He cares for his students and it really shows in his time spent writing detailed answers.",
      "Professor Fodor is a great professor! I had the opportunity to take his CSE307 lecture and it was a fantastic learning experience. Highly recommend taking his courses; he is very understanding and flexible when it comes to deadlines.",
      "Professor Fodor is one of the best professors that I've ever had. He has tremendous patience in working with his students, particularly when explaining OOP concepts in a digestible format during his lectures. I appreciated his open-door policy in helping students struggling with the coursework as well as those looking for academic advice.",
      "Paul Fodor is a very engaging and knowledgeable professor. I highly recommend taking his classes if you have the opportunity to do so.",
      "Professor Fodor is a hard working person. If you went to his office hour, you can always see a long line waiting for the suggestion or guidance of their assignments. Besides, he is highly skilled not only in programming but also the research having a lot of papers published at the top conference. I learned a lot from him. Anyway, I would",
      "Professor Fodor has excellent skills in teaching. I have taken two courses with him during my master, principle of programming language and computing in logic. He shows strong care and responsibilities to all the students in the class and he is very patient to answer any questions. He is also a hard working professor.",
      "Had CSE114 with Prof Fodor, and it was one of most helpful and remarkable courses I ever took. I was not knowing much about computer science, but his course helped me so much on understanding major concepts of it along with very practical coding practices. Prof Foder is very helpful and patient with students. Take his courses! Highly recommended!",
      "Took classes with Prof Fodor for the Honors intro CS sequence at SBU. He lectures very eloquently and takes time to answer everyone's questions. Test difficulty can range, but has more than reasonable expectations for HW and labs and gives worksheets with practice questions to discuss and reinforce understanding",
      "He is one of the most helpful and friendly professor I have come across. His methods of teaching and explaining things are very well thought out and given at a level that the students can understand. His enthusiasm in class make the lectures enjoyable. Overall, he is an excellent professor.",
      "Professor Fodor is one of the best professors in the Computer Science department. His lectures for CSE 215 were very clear and helpful. He gave us a lot of extra credit for doing the homework in LaTex. He was always available during his office hours if you had any difficulty with the course."

      "Quality, organized instruction, not a \"you tell me\" kind of professor. So nice and casual with a real sense of humor in lectures. The class is very efficient with exercises led by TAs, MCQs in lectures done with the person next to you, and autograded coding assignments. All exams are MC with a lot of extra credit. Excellent 101 course!",
      "he cares about his students and he was very accommodating to me when i had a disability. he tried to keep us engaged during his lectures and they were easy to understand.",
      "Lectures aren't recorded, but no attendance mandatory.\nThe homeworks are interesting, but very fair. The tests also aren't too bad.",
      "Definitely best professor to have for an introductory computer science class! The homework and labs are a bit challenging, but if u pay attention to his lectures and/or go over his modules, it's not too bad. Exams are a lot easier than homework and labs, and he gives a lot of bonus questions as well to help boost ur grade. Take his class if u can!",
      "Now this is how you teach an introductory course. First year at Stony and my first time ever taking computer science. Absolutely no prior knowledge and it's great. He answers questions and provides examples to help even more. Homework can be pretty difficult though so stay on your toes for that, but just put in the effort. This is my goat.",
      "McDonnell is a great professor & made lectures enjoyable. Although the HW was challenging & time consuming, I appreciated how some of them taught us concepts along with learning about C. Office Hours for 220 are often full of other ppl, so be early. I've only ever briefly spoken to him, but I've gotten the impression that he cares for his students",
      "McDonnell is easily the best professor in the CS department. He's a great lecturer, and the HWs/exams are very reasonable. The HWs tend to be time-consuming, and the course material is definitely not easy, but if you put in effort and manage your time semi-properly you should be fine. Definitely take 220 with him if you have the opportunity.",
      "He teaches very well. Exams are tough but a lot of them come from slides. just make sure to read the slides when studying. CSE 220 is very hard in general with low average on Homeworks and exams",
      "Undoubtedly the best professor. But the class is very difficult, the average grade of whole class for each hw and exam is around 60 - 70.",
      "Great professor, answers question on piazza really quickly.",
      "Professor McDonnell is great, he covers everything that will be the exam in lecture. Even if you dont go to lecture, you can still pass the course and understand the material by the notes he posted on Colab. Hint. Do the ungraded practice quizzes posted on Brightspace, it really will help.",
      "The most goated professor in cs. Lectures actually make sense ,very reasonable and quickest response to emails and piazza.",
      "This was my first computer science class and it was indeed challenging. However, Professor was very supportive and willing to help. He would answer my questions in piazza even on weekends. The amount of work he put into his online course material is apparent. There was a wealth of information. He definitely went above and  beyond. Great Professor",
      "Thorough with his lectures and gave many opportunities for extra credit(includes in class clickers and labs). Hw was easy at first but got very hard and required good understanding of the material. The homework is doable with the lectures but extra help may be needed. Theres many TAs with office hours (except weekends) which was great.",
      "Best teacher ever. He made class fun and entertaining, and would always take the time to work out a problem with me. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and learned a lot. Not too stingy about homework either- he left you the choice to only do 10/12 lab assignments!",
      "I wish all the professors were as great as he is.",
      "One of the best lecturers I've had at Stony Brook. Easily reachable on piazza, and cares a lot about the material he teaches. Definitely take him if you can.",
      "Best professor at Stony Brook. He explains concepts very well and goes over many examples. And overall very chill guy.",
      "Professor McDonnell was the best professor I've ever had. He explains all the concept really well and makes sure all questions are answered. The lectures are engaging and very helpful.",
      "One of the best professor's I've ever had. Honestly cares about each students understanding of the material and always tries his best to make sure we learn. Clearly cares a lot about the subject and teaching in general, and is always active on Piazza and is always very helpful. If you have him as an option, definitely take him!!!",
      "He is a CS savant and great professor. He's also really nice, like the really nice father of your friend in elementary. By the way, every point counts. Don't expect the final to boost you to an A. I got an 85 while class average was 50. Still, me not going to recitation and poor quiz grades brought me down. I learned my lesson.",
      "He's a great lecturer in my opinion. For something as dry as circuitry, he makes his lectures interesting. He designed the course around problem solving instead of memorization which I really appreciate. He's also just a really chill person. His class is definitely one of the hardest CS classes, but he makes you want to put in the effort to succeed",
      "Exams are very thorough so do the practice problems, go through the quizzes, and read through the lecture slides. Don't cheat or find any shortcuts because this class prepares you just a bit for 320. It builds foundation. As long as you don't waste free time and only study, it should be fine, especially if you take it with 216. Very possible As.",
      "Amazing professor. Hard course overall imo but he really helped. Willing to meet and help outside office hours. Very informative lectures with great practice problems for tests and quizzes. Midterms and final were hard, but fair.",
      "Nice professor, but be aware that his tests are usually not easy.",
      "The tests are NOTHING like the homework. No matter how many times you practice whether its the homework or practice test, all the test questions 90% of the test questions are curve balls and trick questions. No extra credit, nothing. If you want to get above a B even when putting in effort, don't take this class",
      "I didn't break the curse of an A-(No A for 220 on rate my professor still). Such duty shall be completed by you guys next semester",
      "Best professor in CS department. Good at teaching!",
      "Along with professor Steven Skienna, professor McDonnell is one of the best professors at Stony Brook University. Lectures are very organized with well-organized materials and great explanations in the lecture.",
      "McDonnell is one of my favorite professors at SBU. His lectures are extremely clear and intuitive and he makes it easy to understand each topic. Attendance is not mandatory but his lectures really are helpful. His lecture slides are equally excellent. Lots of homework but it's good practice. He is also very helpful and friendly in office hours."

      "Huge stickler for academic honesty, gave an \"academic honesty assignment.\" All he says is work it out yourself when introducing a topic, basically \"I refuse to teach you, find someone else. And ANY outside resources are prohibited.\" A TA told a student loudly not to take a picture of the board. Average is ~60 and curved to prevent collaboration.",
      "Arguably one of the overall worst professors in the department, and definitely the rudest. Doesn't answer questions asked in lecture, or gives a very snide answer expecting the student to know better. Is extremely rude in emails, and most lectures usually consist of simply regurgitating what is on the slides. Avoid at all costs.",
      "cannot teach for the life of him and does not know how to answer students' questions. I absolutely hated this class. if you got into the honors cse program, id say youre better off taking cse 215(regular version of 150) instead of this class.",
      "worst class i have ever taken, condescending towards students and does the \"well what do you think\" when you ask a question about homework, gives practice exams but doesn't provide answer key because he \"wants to reuse the questions in the future so cannot give out answers.\" will talk down to TAs in front of students.",
      "Had the necessary content in the lectures, but really makes you figure out most of it on your own. Kind of a frustrating way to teach but I guess it does help you understand the material better. Tough grader but good curve, but that might just be honors. Also, his demeanor makes him a little unapproachable.",
      "Not good at teaching, homeworks are hard, very rude. It's obvious he doesn't care about making sure the students understand the material, just goes through the motions. If you're an incoming CS student, just take CSE214 and you'll actually learn something useful.",
      "Did System Security graduate course with him and absolutely enjoyed it. Very tough course regarding homeworks and exams, but very useful! If you're into security you should definitely take this course. Although it takes a lot of energy, it's well worth it in the end!",
      "I took his algorithms course (PhD section). He don't go into the detials of the algorithms, instead prefers the high-level stuff. His algorithms course is pretty abstract.",
      "GOSH. HE IS BASICALLY TERRIBLE AND TERRIFYING. MY GPA CRUSHES CRAZY BECAUSE OF HIM.",
      "You should totally depend on yourself, push yourself.  Or you will not survive his course.    Good material, Bad instruction.",
      "He assigns difficult homeworks which he claims should only take 6 hours but end up taking days to complete. There is little guidance in the course and he sets a 'C' to 10 points above the exam average. His projects are difficult and 12 of his TA's absolutely suck and hes terrible at clarifying things. Jokes about failing graduating seniors -_-",
      "Worst professor ever! Homeworks are long and tedious. His lectures are not enough to do the homeworks. The average score was  62 in the midterm and it's a grade C. Therefore, about half of the students failed. He literally does nothing to help you with your questions or issues. He pretends it's not his problem at all. He never takes responsibility.",
      "He simply just recited the common rules. You felt like you got a refreshment in freshmen level programming course in class. However, you will feel you know closely to zero when working on his frequent homework.",
      "He is one of the worst teacher in SBU , if not the worst. He gives B grade to people who get above average scores, he doesnt know the maths behind algorithms and still wants to teach Fourier series. Gives 10-12 problems on every homework(12 HW in total!!) and expects you to finish it in 3-5 hours. Make a fun subject become a torture for everyone.",
      "Slides are of no use with lot of mistakes. Just dictates the content of the slides and will hardly able to explain the doubts. Gives lots of homework throughout the semester and give only 30% for the final grade and the rest 70% for exams. Very tough and worst grader, he expects good number of students to fall below B grade. Avoid his class please.",
      "A very poor professor. Whatever you ask in the discussion forums, he gives a rude reply. Classes are extremely boring and non-interesting but his assignments are very tough. Avoiding his class is the best way to avoid hours of agony.",
      "Was a pretty good teacher and was interesting enough to listen to. The amount of work assigned seamed appropriate. However he was really very harsh in the final grades that he gave everyone. He does not curve very nicely.",
      "I'm wondering how this guy become a professor since he hardly make students feel like being educated, but being humiliated. How could this happen.",
      "i hate this guy. i hate is face. i hate his attitude. i hate the way he teaches. i wish someone can punch this guy in the face real hard cuz i feel like doing the same.",
      "Avoid at all cost. hes not willing to help anyone. his lectures are useless. the book is totally useless for his class. his projects are unbelievably hard. his final is so frikin long. i worked my fckin ass off n he faild me in the end. he fckin sucks. stay away from this guy.",
      "If you can survive in his class, you literally can lean anything on your own!",
      "He is not willing to help you in his office hour. He provides slides with many errors and not correct them. I think He is unprepared for his class and unable to explain clearly the main idea of this class.",
      "I hate this professor",
      "It's an honour to be Prof. Sekar's student. He's simply outstanding.",
      "He's rude and unhelpful, reads mostly straight from the slides, and provides us with some of the most worthless code ever to use in our projects, which are also useless.  The exams are designed to test speed rather than comprehension, and the overall class was just awful.",
      "Professor Sekar is one of the best guys around in terms of his expertise and skill set and what not. Approachability wise, I would actually give him zilch. He's good for those who know what they're into and have a good background. For starters, you're definitely in trouble unless you're a fast learner. He's VERY FAIR though. Understanding too.",

      "The toughest course among the seven courses I took. The course is math heavy, also involves quite a few programming tasks. Professor's oral English is poor. By taking the course, you have to push yourself to watch tons of YouTube videos and read tons of reading materials. CMU's Mitchell and Stanford's cs229, cs231n have great resources online.",
      "He teaches you 1+12, and tests you calculus. Too many homework.",
      "Very poor slide selection with minimal data. Also, lectures are not recorded on Echo. His teaching style is very bad and is not able to clear even a single doubt in class. Home Assignments are way to difficult to complete and has very minimal significance with the actual subject.",
      "His communication skills are bad. He couldn't explain things clearly. If you ever have a talk with him, you would probably end up being educated instead of having a friendly chitchat. This guy has an ego issue.",
      "Professor left the topic \"segmentation\" which is one of the most important topics in Computer Vision. He covered some stuff which I didn't find much useful. He doesn't explain things clearly - just shows you some horrifying equations and you yourselves have to understand bits and the pieces. And oh - Tough Grading",
      "The course material is hard itself and he could teach it better. The exams were really hard, and from other universities. Homeworks take a lot of time to finish, and lots of students don't finish them. He expected a lot from students, but at the end of semester didn't even provide us with the details of our grades.",
      "He could not teach probably, lots of grammar errors in his speaking. Exams are from another universities such as Washington and Berkley so they are not biased to the level he taught. Everyone will get a B-, but getting A  and A- is hard.",

      "Man professor R Kelly was truly sensational as a professor to say he left an impeccable mark on me is an understatement, his one on one office hours are a delight, he really enhanced my freshman experience but for some odd reason all assignment were always graded under, out of 18 points dont know why. Would take this proffesor over and over again.",
      "Where do I even begin. This man has fundamentally changed my life. I simply don't understand the criticism. Prof. Robert Kelly was the best professor I've ever had. Absolutely inspirational man nonetheless. I am so grateful that I was able to have a 1 on 1 experience with someone who now I consider my idol. God bless Prof. Robert Kelly.",
      "This professor is insanely inconsistent in grading presentations. You are on his bad side he will be extremely harsh on you for no reason. Be prepared to glaze him to get a good grade",
      "I cannot believe that the CSE course topic can be the heavy American politics. You have to practice and debate regarding politics not programming. If you can vote in the US and you are white, then take this course. This is easiest course and if you are not, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. You can experience the worst treatment from him.",
      "Compare to other 308, I think his semester-long project is the hardest one. If you are interested in taking 308 with him, you had better to have a teammate who is good at algorithm. For the final presentation, you need to prepare some reasons to persuade him that your algorithm is correct otherwise you will lose points for many use cases.",
      "Dr. Kelly has a lot of experience in the real IT industry, but not in teaching. The HW and tests/quizzes are challenging and he allocates grades weirdly. There's a final group project which will either be fun or suck, depending on the teammates you chose. His lecture material is actually useful/interesting, though. If you love IT, choose Dr. Kelly.",
      "Worst professor I ever had for any class. I was practically a straight-A student when it came to my Computer Science courses until I had this guy. Extremely disorganized, changing requirements of our semester-long project literally right up to the day before. Unfortunately the character limit is too low to begin to explain how awful this guy is.",
      "he gave me the lowest project grade in the entire class for having the most well thought out and well written slides, because it took to long, then he ask me a question and I answered it, again and I answered it then again until what I said was unrelated to what I was talking about. He also asked about something completely unrelated to IT, thanks..",
      "This class is not bad. Prof. Kelly can be really confusing sometimes, and the class participation and extra credit thing can be un-fair since you there are only four TAs walking around, in the back. The professor himself is a realy nice guy, though. His impression to me is that he's willing to help, and he is pretty appreachable.",
      "Avoid taking this class with him if you can. 312 is known to be an easy class but Kelly puts 30% of your grade on class participation. You're fighting for points against 100 classmates because he chooses who gets to talk. In an 'easy A' class, don't be surprised to get a B from him. His grading criteria is suited for classroom not lectures of 100+",
      "Kelly's a really nice guy, but can be confusing with his feedback. For the project he told me to revise a few things on my slides, and when I showed him the revised material he told me to fix things he didn't even mention were inadequate the first time, which lead to a lot of last minute work.  He's always willing to help though, very approachable.",
      "He does have a lot of extra information in his lectures that aren't needed for the exams but, the answers are all there. Do know that the midterm is 30%, while the final is only 15% of your grade. This is because your group project is worth 35%. I got A on midterm, 85/100 for project and C+ on final. did all homework, did okay on quiz and got an A-",
      "This class was... confusing. I felt like I didn't learn anything from him. Lecture notes were useful. Honestly, I don't know how I passed at all. The only ones who really knew what they were doing were people who've done the material before. And I learned much more from my peers than from the actual class itself.",
      "I genuinely enjoyed 308 with Kelly. It's a capstone course so don't take it till your last semesteryear. The project is in Java EE and you pick your persistence layer. He's very useful when it comes to learning EE technology but class was basically useless. Class is solely about the project. Easy midterm, easier final. Design can be tedious.",
      "Guys... you must obey that he is the god. He seem to be a neat person with the sense that everything he said was correct however, most of us found that he just gave contradicting statements. he is actually very disorganized.   More importantly, he takes no measure to help student. You must obey to him. Good lucks.",
      "Took this in the Spring. Pretty fun class, even though he's a bit of a dry lecturer. His grading scheme is annoying, but in the end more people get a solid grade then you'd think. Learned a lot of terminology and concepts. Brought in an FBI guy to talk with us, which rocked. The final project was much easier than either 218 or 305.",
      "Never take any of his classes. He is literally the worst professor ever. If you understand material in basic terms and answer questions in your words, it's wrong, even though the answer is correct. For his quizzes, if you are over the time by a second, he won't collect it. He's not helpful in anything during his office hours either.",
      "WORST TEACHER IN 4 YEARS OF COLLEGE. Comes to class 10 minutes late. Boringly talks about his useless powerpoint slides, and then leaves. Your ONLY chance of doing well is if you constantly teach yourself through reading textbook, tutors or internet help. Worst teacher, should be fired.",
      "Not difficult, but not easy. A lot of quiz questions come from the slides and the textbook. His slides are useful, but the key to success is doing examples and reading the textbook. Final project can either be simple or really difficult. Emphasis on teamwork. Midterm is easy if you know your stuff. Final was based on slides posted the night before.",
      "I had him for both ISE 218 and 305. The way he grades is very odd, the final project is 35% of your grade and the final is 10 to 15% (depends which class). His lecture notes are useless and his tests and quizzes catch you completely off guard.",
      "Knowledgable professor, but you should read the textbook for a better understanding of the material. Quiz questions are straight from the textbook. Final project is 35% of your grade. Not an easy class or professor.",
      "Nice professor who has concerns for his students. Quiz questions are straight from the textbook. It's better to self teach yourself by reading the textbook. Final project its 35% of your grade. Not an easy class or professor.",
      "One of the worst professors at Stony Brook. This guy does not explain anything. I basically had to teach everything to myself. Stay away from him if you can",
      "He is not an enthusiast professor. He is unclear about the course and much demanding. Although you cannot expect more from him, he expects a lot from you as you are like a James Bond. I would stay away from him if I really want to learn. Unless, you are a self learner, his class and power points do not help either.",
      "Very unclear on what he wants. Also demanding when it comes to the final project.",
      "Class was tough, he does not clarify what he wants on the final project until the last couple of weeks. Material in the class isnt worthwhile but the project turned out to be huge. Start understanding what type of project he wants early, understand the technology and you'll do fine.",
      "absolutely terrible professor, forgets what he says in class, misleads about content on exams, changes syllabus a week before the final! AVOID",
      "Got an A! However, he was the one of the WORST, if not the worst professor, I have had. Avoid if possible. Got a 91 on the final but it wasn't very Comprehensive. Focused almost exclusively on GUI! And he put a question on color which he told us NOT to worry about. AVOID-- Was a miserable semester. lol.",
      "Great prof. Teaches very well and connects it to the real world. Kept the class reasonably difficult. Do what he says and you'll get an A. Would definitely take any class with him.",
      "Fairly easy class. Took over after Mr. Pawagi left. The Midterm and Final Exam was explicitly announced several times to be on the Sections Covered on the CSE Webpage. Only effort was needed to get a good grade in his class. I have no complaints."

      "AVOID HIM AVOID AVOID HIM",
      "Tripathi isn't the best. His homeworks and labs are fine, barring his insane zero-credit late policy. The tests are where the course really falters. Most of the exams are comprised of random Java trivia questions that are quite literally useless in gauging your actual coding abilities. I would recommend taking another professor if possible.",
      "Professor Tripathi sets pretty reasonable and fair expectations for this class. The quizzes are fairly short and not worth that much so even if you don't do too well its still ok. The midterm is pretty heavy in terms of content and can be a little rough if you cheat on assignments and don't go through the lecture slides. The final is really fair.",
      "provides online lectures and examples",
      "I love this professor so much he is interactive and kind and truly tries to make you understand the material.",
      "75% of your grade is decided by 3, handwritten tests. Both required labs and homework's are taught by the TA's and yourself because he is usually 2-4 topics behind. Review sheets are cake walks compared to tests that he doesn't give enough time for, and that has multiple questions on information he hasn't taught or brought up once. Good Luck",
      "He's a nice person but it definitely felt like he didn't really care about teaching this class, probably since the original professor bailed last minute, but regardless. He spent a lot of time on a really simple topic at the beginning of the semester and as a result, this class lagged a month behind the syllabus and we didn't finish the curriculum.",
      "The professor is okay at teaching but doesn't care for the class to an extent. Prepare for hastily/lazily made homeworks and lack of materials made. Exam topics are given in a short notice and he reviews lecture slides which don't do much. Exams are designed to trick you rather than to test your knowledge.",
      "Tripathi isn't a bad lecturer, but just understanding the lectures won't result in good scores on the exams or quizzes. Exams mostly reflect material taught in lecture, but often test on small details and often requires a lot of memorization of implementation. Homework usually take a lot of time to complete, and directions sometimes aren't clear.",
      "All the homework's are filled with numerous errors that the TA's themselves don't even understand it. Numerous questions are asked on Piazza, and the professor hardly responds to any. Professor also lags very behind on the syllabus.",
      "It's actually laughable that this professor teaches such an important course for students interested in studying computer science at the university. I feel they do this on purpose to discourage or flat out reject people from the program. Sad to see.",
      "Tripathi is very lenient if you give him a valid reason. He taught pretty well and I understood almost everything. The course is challenging but manageable as long as you attend every lecture, study for every exam, and attend all the labs. He was also very approachable during office hours and before/after class.",
      "Poor communication and time management skills",
      "Caring Professor, rushes some lectures but always answers questions. Tests were hard but fair. You need to put the time in to study.",
      "Very knowledgeable, but none of it will rub off on you. Tests are nightmares because the questions have more to do with special cases and minute details than core principles. No study guides either, the advice given is to simply understand the topics. Never before have I walked out of a test questioning whether one week of studying was insufficient",
      "I can never believe someone really rated him as a good professor... That's definitively a lie. \n\nThis Praveen something does not give students readable slideshows in class, it's so UNREADABLE, making every code unnecessarily difficult to understand, as if he almost deliberately wanted his students to received extremely poor and bad-looking grades.",
      "Professor Praveen Tripathi is absolutely not the one. I took his course because of the unjust school system favored upperclassman course selection\nHis lecture is not understandable, giving students very difficult exams, not even asking the main or key information, but rather some unimportant weird questions brings you terrible test results HW hard.",
      "Nice",
      "The tests try overly hard to reduce your grades. Rather than testing mostly on general things you should learn and take away from the lectures, the tests try to only focus on small-scale \"exceptions\" or really trivial things to get you to get those wrong. Vocabs, while important, didn't feel like such a necessary thing to focus on for this class.",
      "The main issue in this class was the disconnect between the lectures and the tests. Lectures focused more on theory, tests were more about being a human debugger. He also loves trick questions, and you'll encounter many in both tests and lectures. His lectures are helpful if you go into them having already skimmed the textbook and practiced a bit.",
      "Lags behind syllabus and exams are NOT it.",
      "If you have a choice, never take his class. His class is terrible and he teaches his notes from another professor. His reviews for quizzes and exams has nothing to do with them. His reviews for quizzes/midterms are completely different. All his reviews are non-existant and he writes things on the quiz/test that he have never mentioned ever!!!",
      "For this class, it'll be in person and he wont accommodate anything you need. If you have covid, you either have to take the test on the make up day or still come in and take the exam disregarding having covid. He won't budge and accommodate you unless you get some type of special approval from your department. Very lecture heavy.",
      "This professor is so bad. Don't take him if you have another choice. Paul Foder is a 10/10 professor if you need 114. If you take him, be prepared to be ignored for as his concern for your probelms is idgas.",
      "terrible prof and tests are unreasonable",
      "Completely incompetent professor.",
      "Easy class , I suggest taking CSE110 beforehand. Just do the labs and watch the lectures and you should be fine, he's nice enough to post everything for referencing back to them during homework.",
      "Make sure you study outside of class, and practice questions that was not on his practice exams. Other than that he is a great professor, make funny jokes in lecture as well and is easy to approach.",
      "Cannot explain properly, didnt learn anything from him, had to learn by myself",
      "Very bad at explaining, lectures are boring",
      "Useless prof",
      "Not helpful",
      "Probably the worst cs teacher in the school",
      "He's being reviewed bombed but he really isn't all that great of a professor. Great guy. Doesn't teach well but class is relatively easy if you know Java beforehand.",
      "zzzzzz",
      "Might as well enroll in YTUBE101 instead to learn java",
      "After tripathis class, i can safely say, I learned absolutely nothing from him",
      "Have fun learning java on ur own",
      "Useless practice exams",
      "How is it that such a professor exists? His exam is convoluted and worthless as a measurement of competency. His only goal is to eliminate you from the program. His practice exams serve as a reminder of what will not be tested because he will only test you on the most arbitrary nonsense in order to make you get a worse grade. Worst professor.",
      "I took Professor Tripathi a couple of years ago, and he was a great lecturer & professor. He genuinely wants his students to succeed and presents lecture material in an intuitive way.",
      "He was slow on progress but the lectures are amazing which make sure you understand the material. Quizzes are free points since he gives you infinite amount of chances to complete it within a day. Labs sometimes require you to learn the material beforehand. One midterm and one final only but they bring my score down , so get ready!",
      "Prof Tripathi is kind at heart and definitely cares about his students. He's always willing to help and his office hours are useful. For CSE114 you'll have two labs per week, which aren't too bad, especially if you have previous Java coding experience. He gives practice tests which are useful but MUCH easier than the actual midterm/final.",
      "He is terrible professor in Stony Brook. He teaches the CSE 114 TOO EASY. I cannot learn anything I want to learn. If you take his CSE 114, you will feel CSE 214 much harder because he did not teach anything difficult that will equip you to the future CSE course.",
      "He is one of my best professors so far. I failed the first midterm but he still told me \"You are a good student\" when I talked to him about this. I studied very hard for the final and worked hard for my group project. Finally, I miraculously got an A.",
      "Course gives many opportunities to bring your grade up. The professor has a good pace with each subject.",
      "Praveen is a very good teacher who cares about the content he lectures about. There is a fair amount of homework/assignments but if you've had prior programming experience before this class, CSE 114 with Praveen should be an easy A.",
      "Prof. Tripathi tends to grade students on small mistakes on midterms, but he is incredibly passionate about the content and will help you if asked. Do the assignments consistently and practice writing all of your code on paper and you'll pass. Getting an A is not easy, even with prior experience in Java or another programming language.",
      "Praveen's lecture's aren't the best, but he's a very nice guy! If I got lost in his class, I just referred to the slides to learn the basic material. Otherwise, I personally really enjoyed his positive energy. Exams are a little more difficult than the usual. Worst of all though, was MyProgrammingLab... I just gave up on that entirely after a week.",
      "Tripathi doesn't have much experience teaching a class, but isn't too demanding of the students. He doesn't explain things very efficiently, but luckily the course content is easy to understand. Tripathi posts review guides for all quizzes & tests. As for CSE 114/214, they're designed to be hard (it's not his fault). You don't have to attend class."

      "Teaches courses that naturally cover hard content (so difficulty rating will be high), but Chowdhury himself is a very understanding professor who makes the difficult material much easier to digest. He is also very open to extending HW deadlines if asked, and gives a generous curve and cutoff at the end of the sem.",
      "Professor Chowdhury tries his best to make sure students follow along his lectures, constantly looking out for if students have questions. Naturally, the course material can be complex but Chowdhury has an expert understanding of the topic and can answer any question you throw at him. As a bonus, the grading is incredibly lenient.",
      "Nice professor!",
      "Lenient professor, assignments and material wasn't too difficult. Pacing was extremely slow during the middle of the semester and sped up very quickly at the end of the semester.",
      "Absolutely amazing course. Even though this is an undergraduate honors level course, he showed up no mercy and outright taught graduate level topics. The best part is that he did a great job. He was very patient and tried his best to make sure everyone understood. He knows the class is hard and gave his all to help us.",
      "Hardest class I've ever taken in my life. It was all worth it because now I'm a god at coding challenges.",
      "This course is amazing. I learned more than basics of multithreaded programming. Excellent homeworks, especially the first one. The professor is always available during office hours and genuinely wants to help. I totally recommend taking his courses. He is one of the best at Stony Brook University.",
      "Professor is very helpful. The course majorly consists of analysis of algorithms, so it's more of Math. If you are interested in the course, no one can teach it better than Prof. Rezaul",
      "Good",
      "He's amazing and patient and tries to help you to whatever extent he can. Go to office hours for clearing your doubts. Office hours are the best time to learn.",
      "Professor teaches really well. You have to just listen to his class carefully. No extra efforts needed. Assignments are little tough but they open up your mind. Course has little more mathematics. But he warns about the mathematics in very first class. Also he is very approachable and clear all your doubts. Very Student friendly teacher",
      "Good course",
      "Some of his test  contain questions that have nothing to do with material in class. They are competitive programming questions. One  example is Lining up Legos on midterm 1.  It was worth 30 out of 75 points.  Is he recruiting for his for his icpc team or teaching algo's? How do you study for something like that?",
      "Very good professor, Teaches very well that even person without background will learn it well.",
      "If you want to learn algorithm analysis techniques, this class has everything for you. He is an awesome professor. The course materials enables you to learn amortize analysis, randomization, approximation and many others. This learning helped me a lot in other subjects also. Moreover, he is very caring to his students and gives good grade.",
      "Yeah, materials are not easy. But, he helps you a lot. Go to his office hours. He will kindly assist you as much as possible. You will learn a lot, if you work hard. Honestly, if you work hard and he knows that work you hard (of course, you must show him that you actually understand the materials in hw, test, etc), don't worry about your grade.",
      "His lecture is amazing. Clear and interesting.  Homework is hard but get you work on it,  and very useful for later study.",
      "Course material is somehow difficult,  but you can indeed learn something from it. Homework is team work and grades are generally higher than expected.",
      "The prof is good. Yet the class is hard. It takes a long time to finish every homework.",
      "The professor is really good in his field, and his teaching contents are advanced, not really a good choice for beginners, but beneficial for those who want to work in this field. Also, he is caring and gives good grades, and I appreciate that.",
      "If you really wanted to learn Algorithms this is the class you should take. Professor is very helpful and provides all the necessary help that is required to solve any algorithm problem. He is very much approachable and friendly. Yes homeworks are tougher. But, you will get hints and help when asked for. Both good for Learning and gaining grades.",
      "This course is a bit difficult, but if you are major in CS you can not miss it.  Very helpful to understand many useful algorithms and ideas behind them.  Course was elaborately designed, homework  closely linked to lecture, and exam closely related to homework. You will feel smooth during your leaning process.",
      "Great lectures. Although this course wont help you with the materials for interviews,  it would definitely be a great learning experience in the world of algorithms. Assignments are generally difficult and many students get crammed into a very small range of marks at the end of this course. Even missing one lecture would leave you blank in the next",
      "Very nice Professor. Although his assignments and exams are bit difficult, but they mostly follow from what was taught in class. Lectures are easy to follow except 2 or 3 at maximum. Overall, great learning. Would recommend to take this course.",
      "Seems like a nice guy but his lectures are pretty much impossible to follow.  After a few minutes, I would give up trying to understand what was happening. The HW and midterm exam was very difficult and got terrible grades. However, the final exam was fairly easy and somehow, the majority of the class surprisingly got good grades",
      "Very hard to understand during lecture and with very difficult assignments. Not a great combination. If you can avoid taking him for 373 you definitely should. Never taught an undergraduate course so he doesn't really know what he's doing also comes to lecture often saying he hasn't prepared any material for the day. Definitely a mess of a course."

      "This class was free. Homework time frames are reasonable, the quizzes are based on the previous lectures so its really easy as long as you go, The Projects are less development based and more conceptual which I didn't like too much but they were still pretty interesting. Professor Scarlatos was very nice and very helpful.",
      "The main drawback to taking EST 205 with Dr. Scarlatos is that the lectures are boring. Most of them and are redundant and have too many videos. She isn't passionate about the course (goes to a lot of conferences). Attendance is measured with random quizzes. There are 2 group projects and a lot of small, easy homeworks.",
      "She is the worst professor that I have seen!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER take her class!!!!!!!!!!!",
      "Misses lectures herself but oh lord if you miss one class, you fail. I learned nothing in this class. Shes sweet but as a professor not so great. Homeworks and assignments are never graded. Class was too big.",
      "Very disorganized. Homeworks are collected on piece of paper. Never updates grades or communicates through blackboard. Didnt show up to 4 lectures. You dont really learn anything but do some homeworks and assignments. Overall a bad experience. Youll have no idea how youre doing in the class till you get your final grade.",
      "The whole premise of being forced to take an extra one credit class for a letter grade is really dumb, but that's not her fault She's really nice and gives very little hw - about a paragraph of writing a week, and towards the end of the semester you are put into groups to work on developing apps.",
      "Thought she was nice in the beginning, but hasn't graded anything but three quizzes since semester started. Didn't even come to her own final. Class is 50% design projects which have yet to receive a grade. Flaky in grading... not very helpful in general.",
      "Professor Lori is such a sweetheart. The class is fun. No coding necessary. If you do your work, you can expect a good grade.",
      "Class actually talk about what need to be done or what need attention for designing a game, the class is sort of fun, class work is no sweat stuff can be done easy. Lori is nice to student and not abusive.",
      "She's an amazing teacher! First of all she's not strict at all on attendance, you can even see she wouldn't mind if you missed some classes. Also she's really nice and really does her best to help everyone and make the environment fun and brightened."

      "Genuinely cares about students learning in her class and wants the best for you as a student taking her class",
      "Really a bad lecture and professor",
      "I agree with most of the previous ratings. This is the worst professor I have ever had. She even does not understand what she was teaching, her lectures and emails are always confusing and full of typos and errors. I don't understand why the department still let her teach courses. I will rate her as negative infinity if possible!",
      "She is the worst professor I have ever taken. She can't teach, is arrogant, and frequently lashes out at people including her own TAs. THe only reason I took her class is since she is a free A by reusing old exam questions. However, now she wants the TAs to grade more harsly to \"encourage\" students to go to class since no one goes to class.",
      "The professor cannot spell, as evidenced by the emails she sends out. Terrible lecturer with an inflated ego and self importance. No student takes her seriously, but her easy As are a blessing. It is worth suffering through hours and hours of bad English, boring teaching, and horrible attitude to get an easy grade that would boost your GPA.",
      "You can tell me that she makes typos, is boring, and is a bad lecturer. However, you can't tell me she doesn't bless your grade. Just check Classie for 371 and 303 from last semester. Going online made this an easy A. Idc about learning logic, I'm never gonna use it anyway. I had a job lined up and I just needed the degree. She made that happen.",
      "SHe is a VERY good. ALWAYS quizzes are TRIVIAOL. DONT forget that she is yuor friend. Use the study guide as shown on syllabus and always READ SYLLABUS. ALL IS THERE ! Beautiful professor.",
      "This class was an absolutely atrocious experience. Her lectures are absolute garbage because she literally can't explain anything. One time a student asked a completely valid question and she responded with \"trivial\", but when a student asked an easy question, she said \"AMAZING QUESTION. I'LL ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW\".",
      "Her TAs are very tough when grading you on the exams and quizzes. If you don't have the exact answer to a question provided on the answer key, you lose all the points on that question.",
      "You could tolerate this class for giving easy A in the past. But this semester it's much more difficult and require 10 more efforts for an A. Must avoid.",
      "This is one of those classes where you can skip every single lecture and still get an A just by reading the slides/doing practice tests a day or two before the exams. You're better off doing this anyway because her accent turns her english into russian and her teaching is garbage. I recommend this class though because you can sleep in and get an A.",
      "The slides are horrendous and full of spelling mistakes. She is rude and an egomaniac. Thinks she invented computer science. Badmouths other professors who actually have a Google Scholar page and do research. Yells at the students. I am sorry that I spent tuition money on this class and this instructor. No constructive feedback, just empty words.",
      "This professor doesn't go by their word. Watch out for expecting certain grades because you're probably not getting it.",
      "I took this class seriously, but her class is just way too hard to get an A in unless you memorize every single detail in her class. She also didn't give extra credit which would have bumped my grade up even though she said she'd give it at the beginning of the year",
      "She said that she would give credit for our practice final and practice midterm in CSE371, but she never gave it and more than half the class's grades got wrecked because of that. Don't expect extra credit and don't expect the exams to be easy especially if you find her lectures difficult to understand (which is highly likely).",
      "She has such an ego that it's so hard to get anything through to her head",
      "Her lecture slides are unreadable. She doesn't really explain the material well and she only answers to the easy questions.",
      "Her lectures are not helpful for the exam. Don't take her class.",
      "Prof Wasilewska's slides are full of spelling mistakes. She gives the same quizzes and exams from previous semesters. The amount of time spend on this class for an A is less than 5 hours per semester. I am paying tuition and getting into debt and all I am getting out of this class: slides full of typos, and no up-to-date info on an important topic",
      "She actually just yelled at her tas during the quiz. Terrible Professor",
      "One of the worst computer science courses in Stony Brook University. Final Project is very time consuming and is only worth 10% of your grade. Midterm and stupid final determine everything.",
      "Worst class I've ever taken. I learned absolutely nothing from her teaching. Her lectures are horrendous and you won't get anything out of it. All you need to get an A in the class is to memorize the answers to her past exams and quizzes. It's very disappointing because the topics were interesting but the professor was terrible.",
      "Lecture and assignment are all ambiguous. Does a poor job explaining concepts in class and is condescending when you ask her questions. She projects and announcements are copied from previous semesters, complete with same typos. The class has little to do with the project. She never fails to mention that Prof. Kiefer made his slides.",
      "Awful lecturer. Her slides are downright terrible and full of typos which she never corrects. The textbook is just a copy of her lecture notes and isn't that much better. Easy class if you can memorize answers to past exams and quizzes.",
      "Easiest class in my life",
      "Terrible lectures. I am disgusted by how many errors there are in her slides. Every other slide contains a typo. Her quizzes and exams are the same. 5/5 learning difficulty because you'll find yourself buried in the textbook.",
      "amazing easy A",
      "The course is too easy. I spent little time and get A. Taking her graduate course is a smart choice to get an A in PhD qualifier (for PhD students). You hardly learn anything though.",
      "It's not a subject I find too useful in tech industry so I'm glad this course existed for an easy grade. You still have to work for the grade but it's much easier than what it could have been. I wish the professor was a better lecturer. She seems kind but the lectures are just too dull. Hopefully she improves her lecturing for next year.",
      "Although she isn't the best at teaching, I still learned a good amount of stuff. Her lectures are pretty dull, but the material isn't hard at all to understand; she lays a solid foundation for you to study outside of class. She puts up all the assignments and exams from previous years as resources to study from which made everything extremely easy.",
      "She is an ok professor. Gives TONS of extra credits. Even if you get very low grades on your quizzes the extra credits will raise your overall grade. Her exam/quizzes are very similar to the practice ones. Overall, I would recommend to take the course with her.",
      "A caring, lovely professor. She is really good at what she is teaching.",
      "Anita is a very sweet person, and she means well. I happen to find the material interesting, although the way she teaches could be improved, such as being a bit more direct instead of kind of glossing over things and meandering a bit. Discrete math and automata are very dry subjects, so it takes a bit of coaxing to get the material to make sense",
      "She is very nice and friendly. Here course structure is well-defined. You need to follow her lecture slides and homeworks.",
      "This is the most tedious course I've ever had. The professor talked a lot things that is outdated. She uses her own website for notification which has a messy layout and easily miss important information. For the test, you must write exactly the same as she taught in the class, one change in the variable name will also result in deduction in grades",
      "She is really nice and friendly. Make sure you do all the extra credit and do well on quizzes and are basically based on her slides.",
      "She is one of the worst professor in stony brook university.I request everyone not to take her classes because you will repent taking her classes for sure.",
      "For me, the course content was EXTRA BORING. If you want an easy grade while willingly sacrificing your time and neurons, this is the course for you!",
      "She gives TONS of extra credit, and if the class isn't doing well, she gives even more. She's super sweet and really wants everyone to get A's. If you ask for clarification, she'll always give it, but be wary; she is a stickler for precision. What seems like a small error to you can be a quick 0% on a quiz. Memorize the slides and you'll get 100's.",
      "good teacher.  she can be scary but does care a lot about students and teaching.  her class is easy if you keep up with the material.  she also has good slides"

Exams had nothing to do with the review he provided and he barely replied to emails or piazza. Didn't curve the overall grade well, a lost of students including me are failing because of him.",
      "He's clearly not equipped to be teaching a class like this. Gives awful lectures where he just reads off slides that aren't his. Homeworks aren't that tough, but there are a lot of typos and ambiguous sections that he'll often change days after assigning it. Overall grades were bad with no curve at all.

For instance, in our final exam, there were only one or two questions about data paths, whereas the practice exam he provided was entirely focused on performance and data path questions.",
      "Lecture slides are copy pasted from textbook. Misleading study materials that ended up only be 20% of the exam. Doesn't read Piazza post carefully and provide vague answers. HWs are good learning practice. Gave high curve cuz everyone is failing. I understand it's his first time teaching, BUT he has a lot improve on.",
      "Amazing professor. One of the best the CS department has to offer.",

      "McKenna's lectures were often disorganized and unhelpful. He seems to lack understanding of the technologies used in the course project, leaving students on their own. However, the project itself is interesting. Unstuck study was a lifesaver for preparing for the exams.",
      "It can be difficult to reach him by email, making it hard to correct grading mistakes. The final grade is mostly based on the final project. Even if you score top 5 on the final exam and get high homework scores, it is possible to receive below an A- if you don't excel on the final project, that he grades without a clear rubric.",
      "What a pain with emails! EIther doesn't respond or gives a very absurd careless reply.\nI took him because Pramod Ganapathi had an awful rating but now I'm doubting my decision.",
      "The over-reliance on the game engine and its lack of usefulness outside this class leaves something more to be desired. The lectures are too theory-based and learning the engine takes time. And javascript is also expected to have been learned prior. Homework is \"learn it yourself\" too. Not recommended for students looking for easy electives.",
      "If you like video games or making video games for fun, do not take this class. You are forced to use the Wolfie2d engine. It sucks. The lecture and homework are like two seperate classes, one that teaches how to make a game engine and another where you have to learn how to make games yourself. I stress, do not take this class.",
      "\"YOU CHOSE THIS MAJOR\", is what I would hear in the midst of lecture as McKenna was spiraling down another one of his rants. He would spend half the lecture on a single slide with three bullet points. He got so petty, he decided to make mcq midterm short response based off of things he mentioned in class that were not on the slides.",
      "This man is very self centered (he expects you to listen to his every fun fact and trivia) and disregards student emails, questions and concerns. )There was no learning involved, just brute force debugging. I would recommend all 316 professors and all other courses than take a class with this man. I hope we get someone like Mitra back for 316.",
      "Energetic guy and was good at explaining the concepts. I would say grading is mostly fair. However, not very accessible (took forever with emails, \"office hours\" were just that you can talk to him after class), and HW grades took forever to be returned. Also think he could of been clearer/shown more examples of expected formatting for work.",
      "I think overall was a great professor. During lectures he would go off topic a lot, sometimes he would spend more time CS topics of other courses. He tries to explain everything in great detail with lots of examples. Midterm was concept based  and final code based. The course was in python, TS/JS, Haskell, and c++.",
      "CSE 216\nI took this course online this summer (visiting student) and liked it quite a bit. The assignments were fair, the content was presented effectively, and Prof McKenna was a pretty likeable guy. Prepare to use C++, TypeScript, Haskell (ouch), and Python. Midterm is theory based, final is pracapp. Overall one of the best CS profs I've had.",
      "This class requires a ton of self-study. I attended every lecture but did not learn much. His slides do not include important notes and tests are full of trivial questions.",
      "If you emailed Richard for 2 points back on a project because the thing he asked for was not in your project specifications, and you had a terminal illness, he would respond to your email 3 weeks after your funeral to deny your request. If Richard ever became accessible through email or piazza, it would be proof that god is real.",
      "Professor McKenna does a very poor job of explaining requirements, and what he expects out of students. In addition to this, if you are missing something that he did not mention, he will still take points off your assignment for not having it. Being able to read minds was not listed as a prerequisite. Also his exams are just trivia of lectures.",
      "Lectures are useless & there is no connection between the programming & non-programming parts of the class. We just have to memorize theory to pass the tests. It would be nice if he started from HTML/CSS; starting with JS had a learning curve. And please give outside sources so we can learn ourselves.",
      "I wish I could give him a zero because this class is seriously the worst of the worst. I heard this was an easy class but theres just so much to get done for an easy upper division and his grading is not that great either. Dont let the the good ratings fool you.",
      "He is very unclear and spends a lot of time on things that didn't matter. Lots and lots of assignments. I would not recommend anyone to take his class.",
      "Professor is arbitrary, unclear, and doesn't care about (or understand) the workload. He hides behind all criticism by saying it's a senior project class and that he expects workplace or professional quality, but he has to realize that it is still a one semester 3 credit class.",
      "Useless lectures. They have nothing to do with the project, only the midterm. I skipped nearly every class and then binged the lectures the night before the midterm for about 6 hours on 2x speed and got a good score on the midterm. The project is cool but the prof doesn't seem to know the tech/languages behind it well you're sort of on your own",
      "The lectures were cool I guess but I didn't learn anything. I took this class to learn more about game programming and am upset that he was disappointed with our final project because it's not some innovative new thing. If we were actually taught skills that apply to game-making I would have been much more motivated in making a cool game. sadly not",
      "Dislike how McKenna hyped us up about teaching us relevant technologies about game programming (talked about engines like Unity, and Unreal) and then when it times to do our final project(making a game) we have learned nothing relevant. He expects us to dedicate all of our time making some \"innovative\" game and gets upset at our \"boring\" ideas.",
      "the professor expected us to use and develop with technologies that him and his TA have very little information about. This made it very difficult to proceed every time we were stuck. Furthermore, every time we asked a question, he would answer the question in the most vague way possible, which made us more confused than we initially were.",
      "Took a game programming course to learn about exactly that, game programming. I did not take this course to spend a quarter of the semester learning about Computer Graphics then a half semester of things that games do/use, but he has not taught a single bit of \"programming.\" Had to learn things like Blender/Unity/C# on own.(claimed he was teaching)",
      "I have one semester left to graduate, Prof. McKenna is one the best professors I've ever had at SBU. He wants every one of his students to do well. The class is NOT easy but there is more than enough help available (I don't suggest taking during a pandemic, makes getting help harder lol). Nothing but positive things to say about him!!!",
      "The amount you learn from this class is almost nothing. Instead, it is a class where he will talk loudly about games rather than about game programming. He might describe a couple things that used in games but not on how to actually implement or use them. Once teaching absurdly nothing, he will give you large hw's that take a lot of time.",
      "His lectures are boring: he briefly describes technologies without proper explanation how/why/where to use them; lot of his personal stories. Class was all about self learning and most important topics were covered over briefly at the end of semester. It is first semester when this course offered, hope it will be reorganized.",
      "I am also a SUNY-K student who took classes with him. I took CSE214 / CSE219 class with him, and I think that I am lucky to meet him as a professor! Homeworks are fair and manageable, his classes were fun, and I feel that I improved much after learning from him. I wish to have him for other courses :) Thank you for teaching us.",
      "He'll prepare you for your CS career with his amazing lectures. HWs are time consuming and hard but teach you very important concepts. Tests can also be hard but listening to his lectures and understanding the concepts in his slides will help you get a good grade. Overall best lecturer in the CS department, you will learn a lot from his classes.",
      "Learn the material first then try his assignments because he will not teach it before. Other than that the better choice for 114 than Tripathi.",
      "He's probably one of the best professors in CS department. He's lectures were definitely the best. HWs were a little hard but still do-able. Exams were pretty easy.",
      "One of the best professor at stony brook university. If you as a student don't know what responsibility is then don't take his class.",
      "Great lectures, long homeworks. But I really enjoyed this class.",
      "McKenna's lectures are very clear & straightforward, and he's pretty good with outlining his expectations. Definitely one of the best lecturers I've had here. Also, he's good to have a conversation with and fun.",
      "Now in the workforce I appreciate more what I learned. The homeworks were long and hard especially in 219 but later you will see the real benefit of them.",
      "His grading is not clear and his hw are too long. I am foreign Korean student and thought my English was good but I couldn't understand most of his lectures - too fast and his stories not make sense to me. Why all like him so much I am not sure - he will be at SUNYKorea in Fall I will not retake his class even though I need it.",
      "SUNY-Korea CS student also how took his class, like other SUNYK students felt, he not fair to us. Feel sorry for our classmates this term when he at SUNYK for full year - he so unfair in grading doesnt say why you not pass and is of little help. Was worst CS prof I ever have, cause of him I changed major to Math. Don't recomnd taking him if Korean.",
      "Prof McKenna usually teaches CSE 215 in the Summer, and for a 3.5-hour class, he can really make the time fly. One of the things I found most useful about his class were the quizzes. If you answer the questions honestly, it will help you understand the mechanics of answers the homework problems and make exams much easier.",
      "Great professor; exams are very straightforward if you study his slides and attend lecture. Just make sure you start the homework and project right away",
      "One of the best professors I've had. Respects students, students give him respect back. Good at teaching, exams are fair.",
      "He keeps his lectures entertaining by telling stories and making jokes. His exams are multiple choice and really easy. His homework projects can be extremely difficult and time-consuming, so you should never procrastinate.",
      "He LOVES what he does, I always appreciate his attitude.  His class is not hard, but just make sure that you put times on doing the projects. It is not about how important those projects are in grades wise, instead you are preparing yourself as a good programmer.  Make sure you stop by his office to check out those \"collections\" there."

She has an  idol; Michael Scott, and her class is a copy of his CSC254 (He is from Rochester Uni. Also the textbook is written by him).She asks questions about the assignments she assigns for weeks later in her quizzes",
      "This class was easy.  Unlike the person below I thought allowing us to select the project we wanted made the class a lot more fun than a generic project.  The difficulty of this class is more about the people in your group than the teacher.  Homeworks were not bad if your group knew what they were doing.",
      "Stay away from her if you can, difficult to understand and follow. Unlike most professors that give a project for 308, told us to do \"what we wanted\", resulted in a lot of chaos. Assignments unreasonably difficult, gets upset when you ask her questions during office hr. Claims to listen to feedback, but doesn't take it as seriously as she should.",

      "Stark is a great prof and teaches operating systems well. Really hard class, but you end up learning so much. It's definitely a good class to take as an elective, but just make sure it's your only hard class because the projects are extremely time consuming. The curve is massive even though the averages for the assignments and exams tend to be low.",
      "Okay teacher, but ludicrous hw (badly written wall of text), I never fully completed a single one. Hard to follow lectures. Low stakes tests. Grading: 10-20% on tests, 60-70% on hw. Pay attention and ask until you FULLY understand. Textbook was very useful (tho not required). I feel I could've learned so much, but instead focused on doing the hw.",
      "Stark is the best professor in the CS department at Stony. He is active on piazza if you are really stuck. This is one of the few cs courses where you will learn a lot. His homeworks are extremely long, but as long as you follow the instructions and START EARLY, you should get a decent grade. Don't overload yourself with courses when you take him.",
      "He's willing to spend time answering students' questions on piazza. His homework is hard and definitely challenging but he intentionally wants you to learn those stuff on your own. His exams are definitely reasonable if you already understand C well enough. There is no certain way to review for his exam, just plain knowledge test. Good luck!",
      "I learned so much from Prof. Stark's class. He is extremely knowledgable about C and Unix and explains things well. The homeworks were difficult and challenged me more than any other CS class has before; I truly feel that I am a better programmer after taking this class.",
      "I only took the first midterm because of corona. 40 questions general stuff, 10 on the homework. I didn't do much of the first hw but got a decent grade. You have to study online C sites to do well. Also, know what void*(zero) is. The homework is hard. Professor is extremely nice and smart. Sometimes his replies on piazza are sarcastic but funny.",
      "The reason for his low rating is because of the difficulty of his class. However, this professor is really knowledgeable. It seems like he knows the answer to whatever you ask him. I went to his office hours once and he spent a great amount of time and care to answer my question thoroughly. He is surprisingly really nice and helpful if you go to OH",
      "I took both 320 and 306 with Stark, and they were both a challenge. Yes, his tests are extremely hard to study for, but you're not expected to get every question right. He knows the material he's teaching and is very passionate about it, so if you have any interest in systems I advise you to take these courses with him.",
      "Lectures are good, he is always willing to explain every questions. Project workload is heavy. However, he always answers project questions quickly on Piazza. Even though many dislike his class (it is a bit dull), the lecture he gives would be very helpful for the ones who wants to build back-end systems, from a former software engineer's view.",
      "One of the best CS professors in SBU. He will inspire students to actually learn material, not just memorize. Homeworks are some kind of challenging, however, if you read the book before starting homework, you will do great. And material covered is really interesting.",
      "I'm very serious: I have kept my gpa above 3.50 for the entire my college life. This is the moment where my gpa goes down below 3.5. The thing is this. I do very well better than other students when the coursework is pretty doable and well-instructed (in terms of projects/exams), but when it is not, I always fail. Giving too hard tasks is bad.",
      "Useless useless useless useless. Absolute useless. I regret ever taking this class. The fact that Stark is teaching should have already been a red flag. Never take CSE 306. EVER.",
      "CSE320 is hard. But Stark in general is a good professor. He cares about students.",
      "Class is hard as hell, but it's what makes our degree worth it. Stark's lectures are surprisingly good, it's unfortunate that so few people show up. He can be somewhat sarcastic on piazza, which he should probably work on. But this attitude has encouraged me to read closer and think for myself, which has made me a sharper student.",
      "Honestly, despite all the negativity Stark is a great professor. Come to his lectures, give the guy a shot, work on the homework, and youll do fine. Its a hard class but you get a better application for the material afterwards.",
      "The class was difficult but it's supposed to be. He is helpful during office hours but come prepared. I think he gets a bad rep sometimes because people don't really give him a chance but he seems kind to me. Some professors are easy others are more difficult, he's just more difficult. I recommend him if you want a challenge. I'm average or below.",
      "This is my own experience with this professor. This is the first ever professor that will TAKE OFF YOUR POINTS if you consult him for HW issue. In his class, working hard does not give you what you deserve. He doesn't care if you understand the idea. He cares about whether you can replicate his code. It's my first time seeing such a professor.",
      "The thing about Stark is he really knows C and tries to sound enthusiastic about it. However, sometimes his answers aren't exactly coherent, and lecture was just a negative. Homeworks are long, but doable. Make sure you read the textbook and do practice exercises for his tests, you'll really need it.",
      "If the tests were more relevant to what we learned, I might be giving him 3 instead of 1. The tests are also why the difficulty is a 4. I had to retake this class and everything else is basically the same but his tests are ridiculous. EXTREMELY boring in lecture and rambles on a lot. Also roasts people on piazza when they ask (kinda dumb) questions"

      "Prof Amir puts lots of energy into the class and the lectures are great. I also enjoyed the CTF homeworks.",
      "I took my advanced project 523/524 with Prof. Amir and had a great experience. We had weekly meetings for all of the master students to track our progress and a final presentation the last week of class.",
      "Enjoyed the hands on experience. It was Prof. Rahmati's first time teaching the course and although there were some issues with homeworks I think the course was great.",
      "Lectures were very diverse and covered lots of stuff. There were 5 homeworks in total. A couple of them were capture the flag style which I really enjoyed. Midterm and final were tough but the grades were caved so I did fine.",
      "Rahmati isn't amazing but not terrible either. I like the style of his lectures, but at the same time, I wish his lectures were structured in a way such that it is easier to prepare for exams; I spent a decent amount of time going over lectures and still felt a bit unprepared for certain questions. ANNOYING homeworks(!!!!!), hard class overall.",
      "The lectures are very interesting and professor Rahmati covers a lot of topics in this class. I wish we would have covered some topics (e.g. machine learning security) in more detail. Exams were tough but Prof. grades fairly. I didn't do well on midterm, otherwise should have been able to get an A.",
      "Really enjoyed this class. Highly recommended!",
      "The class is hard work. We had 5 assignments, one midterm, and the final. The grading was tough but the professor curved the final grades so people did well overall.",

      "I am taking the class during COVID. Prof. Rahmati was always available in Piazza and post the video of every lecture promptly. The homeworks are tough but gave me hands-on experience with the concepts introduced in the class.",
      "The course covers a wide-range of material in security and is quite comprehensive. There are 5 homeworks that account for 60% of the grade, one midterm and the final. All homeworks are challenging and require coding. They are not something you can finish in a day. The exams are hard but are curved generously. Really happy with the course overall.",
      "Stupid homework. stupid grading rubric. boring and helpless lecture. super tough exam question. DON'T TAKE THIS.",
      "> 4 Papers a week. 2 for each class to review. > Final exam was below par in terms of the standard. It was more of like a textbook exam where you byheart things rather than problem-solving. > Paper review is a good thing as it makes one better critic. > Grading was too strict.",
      "Great lecture, more seminar-like. Read papers before each lecture, and discuss it on it. Group project is great, really enjoyed it.",
      "Four paper reviews per week + a group research project + a smaller individual project. The course load was really high but I enjoyed it very much."

He did an excellent job where insights developed over years of research were distilled. Very approachable, encouraged students to ask questions, voice opinions and develop their own research tastes.",

He never talked to us about anything and expected us to know the homework and help students even without knowing that it had been released. Since the class was online, he needed us to monitor the students but told us like an hour ago.",
      "I have taken over 150 credits of college classes but have never seen someone as horrible as him teaching a class. He does not care about the students and is not at all organized whether it is releasing the assignments or grading them. Just to clarify, my 150 credits are distributed through 5 colleges in NY.",
      "People are trying to take out the whole online classes issue on him. They need to stop, it's not his fault. He used respondus for online tests which is a garbage program and outright spyware. Yeah it was a bad move, but no one knew anything about it to begin with. He's a great lecturer and professor. That's what matters, not respondus.",
      "I don't understand why he's getting such bad rep. He's a great professor. Sure his exams are hard, but his lectures are pretty interesting. He only tests on stuff he's taught and from the textbook, so there's nothing unexpected. Only pet peeve is that he takes forever to answer to emails.",
      "Excellent professor. He really knows his stuff and is able to teach it pretty well. Exams are pretty difficult, but homework is pretty fair. I learned a lot in this class and had a lot of fun.",
      "I have not seen a professor at SBU who is so bad at teaching. He was not even able to get across simple concepts like TF-IDF, forget about the complex topics. Pre-covid19 lectures were not recorded. But that did not matter much. You would probably end up more confused after the class and end up just reading the textbook.",
      "This professor is to be avoided at all costs. His NLP class is extremely vague and unless you actually have a solid background in machine learning, you will be lost in his class. The professor always sound unsure of his own answers and presentations and saying lots of uhms and uhhs. At the end, we only \"learn\" an introduction of the concepts",
      "Sure he's a great researcher with many papers on MENTAL HEALTH, but you wouldn't know he \"knows\" about mental well being. He is one of the most unsympathetic and insensitive professors I've ever seen. His lecture slides are literally just fancy pictures. His exams, quote, \"test concepts\" but then you need to memorize specific equations or R.I.P.",
      "NOT at all understanding of the situation of the students. Look up this_is_ridiculous_how_do_these_people_get_phds on Reddit for details for Exam 2. NEVER posted assignments on the dates announced, replies to emails, replied to Piazza in less than 3 days. Such unclear instructions in the assignments even TAs couldn't help without asking him.",
      "Very difficult to follow his lectures. He's a good man personally and a great researcher, but not the best teacher you'd come across. His assignments are vague and not very helpful.",
      "Amongst the worst professors I've seen at Stony Brook. Doesn't even make an effort to teach some stuff. His slides are just full of images and fancy logos, and he just surfaces through all the stuff. You're expected to learn and study (and even figure out what to learn and what not to) yourselves.",
      "The professor used a skewed grading scale. Those at or around the average got poor grades. His lectures aren't too informative either. According to him, his lectures are just \"visual aids\" to the coursework. Expects you to read the entire book yourselves. Exams  good, but you need to read A LOT."

He's a good lecturer, and the topics chosen were relevant and well-structured. The homeworks were interesting and let us apply what we learned.",
      "His course is very well-organized, and the lectures are amazing. There is a difficulty gap in-between the lectures and the home works though. It is a VERY difficult course, so prepare to work A LOT. He makes you work hard, but you also gain understanding of the subject. This course is one of the hardest ones (the hardest one?) at the CS department.",
      "CSE 628 The course is very disorganized. He will make the subject look easy at the beginning of the course and then dump a lot of stuff at the every end. The assignments were descent but don't expect any help from the instructor. The lectures were ok, all the advanced topics were covered on a surface level, so don't expect to learn much.",

He was always willing to help students understand concepts and was responsive to feedback about the class. I'm glad I took this class with him, and I feel I got a great understanding of NLP as a result.",
      "He does not know how to teach. He needs to learn before teaching. On top of that, the grading is very random. He claims homeworks, exams, project and quiz are part of final grade but gives final grade only based on exams.  Keep in mind that exams are important."

      "Gupta makes the class way more difficult than it needs to be, and grading is very strict on exams. Lectures tend to not be very helpful, and his attitude during them is often off-putting and condescending. On the bright side, homework is worth more of your grade than any singular exam is (which is helpful), and the curve is rather generous.",
      "Gupta is by no means a bad prof just very ill-prepared. It is very clear he shows up to lecture un-prepared and just reads off his slides. He tries to explain but the combination of the accent + being unsure how to solve the questions himself do not help. Homework is 40% of the grade so do it and do it well. Ive heard of a curve but am not sure.",
      "Incredibly unclear lecturer (and thinker). He doesn't prepare for lectures and doesn't consider whether the problems he assigns are appropriate based on what he's covered in class. He assigns great problems, but he often doesn't know how to solve them! Those problems should follow CLEAR explanations in class. I would advise everyone to avoid him.",
      "A talented professor, also a nice person. He is patient while answering questions during office hours.",
      "Idk why but Himanshu was just such a hilarious professor to me even when he wasn't trying to be. He's a super nice prof whose literally willing to explain a concept fully to you until you get it. All of his tests emphasized HEAVILY on proofs (except for a few predicate questions). Monstrous curve in the class. DO THE HOMEWORKS! (40% of ur grade).",
      "Extremely hard to understand. Do not take if you have trouble teaching yourself things and you rely on the professor to teach you. He's a lot better in office hours so if you're in his class, go to office hours. He has extra credit questions in class but they tend to be hard so the kids who don't even need the extra credit are the ones who get it.",
      "Huge curve in the class. He is a good teacher but he skips a lot of intermediate steps when showing you how to do proofs. However, if you learn the general methodology, you will do decent on the tests. He allows for one cheat sheet. He is willing to explain until you fully understand if you go to office hours. Very tough homework.",
      "Very nice man. I personally did not go to that many lectures, because I was lazy this semester, but I did study a lot for the final and got a B+. 40% of the grade are homeworks, and he gives 6, so make sure to do them.  The curves must be big because I thought for sure I was getting a C. Really if you put in the effort you should get a decent grade",
      "Took this course needing a B. Put in a lot of hours of studying and work a week. Lectures aren't helpful, as he doesn't teach, just lets the class work on extra credit problems while he sits on his phone. Don't expect a good grade before the curve, as most of the tests were in the 30s and were considered average.",
      "Very clear and well-spoken professor, he is always there to help you during his office hours. He lets you hand in homework late during his office hours and sometimes by email if you talked to him beforehand.  The material is not easy. You really need to understand the material to do well in the class. Offers plenty of extra credit. Love him.",
      "Professor Gupta notices you if you regularly attend office hours.  He is always readily available to help, and is even easily reachable by e-mail for homework questions.  He absolutely makes you work for it but he will not abandon students if they actively seek assistance. One of the most supportive professors I have ever had the pleasure to have.",
      "He dose not care about grades or curve, what he cares the most is that you understand the material or at least make improvements. He gives you hints or tried to help you learn even during midterms... He also gives out a lot of extra credit, so be in the class. I really enjoyed and learned in this class and end up with an A. He is very brilliant!",
      "Very difficult class. Expect to really read the textbook and digest the information. The first midterm only had 4 or 5 questions where you write out whole proofs. Everything feels ambiguous.  He says your answer is correct \"if you think it's correct\".  He does give in-class extra credit to people who answer his questions though.",
      "I loved his classes. They involve a lot of maths but the professor is very talented. Infact the sharpest that I have seen in campus till date.",
      "Do NOT take him for 215.   He's only recently started teaching it and he's really really really bad at it. The average on the first exam was in the 20s and he assigns the hardest problems he can find in the textbook for homework.   He has an accent and does all the examples in wordpad.",
      "I loved his classes. He made DB very interesting and it was a joyful ride.",
      "I took this subject because of my personal interests even though the review about the professor wasn't so great. The assignments are really hard but he is good in giving hints and help outside the class. Overall, he confident in his subject matter and good with giving grades. He adds Mathematics to most of his problems.",

The material is difficult; you either get it or you don't.  Homework is challenging and tests are hard, but he grades very nicely and is not out to fail students",

Prof. Mitra is a great teacher. He is very patient and is never dismissive of his students. I wish all my CS profs were like him.",

He was also very accessible during office hours, goes over exams with u one by one, and even gave me a small hint during office hours when I was stuck on one of the homeworks.",
      "Mitra is cool. Most reviews here are completely baseless. He records lectures, gives enough study material, and is clear about what he expects. That alone should be enough to rate him highly. His lectures are actually pretty good. He doesn't read from slides but is interactive. Definitely one of the better profs I have taken at Stony Brook.",
      "I don't care what anyone says, Professor Mitra a good teacher and an even better person. I went to his office hours and that really helped me get back on track. His programming assignments are tedious but it's the nature of the course.",

      "Professor Mitra is an engaging lecturer. He encourages and tries to facilitate interaction in class. If you pay attention you can learn a lot in class. His programming assignments are long but clear and most of them have automated tests, which means you get immediate feedback. Exams are reasonable. He provides practice problems, which is awesome.",
      "One of the worst Professors I've had so far. His tests are unreasonably difficult, and he's very unforgiving with grades. He gave a bunch of zeroes to people for one of the assignments, where even if you passed 99% of the test cases, he gave you a zero for the whole thing if one of them resulted in an infinite loop.",
      "Despite the lectures being somewhat decent, the midterm and the final were unreasonably long and difficult such that it was near impossible to finish. It's horrible that the median is a 50 on an exam and the professor not once addresses it. His quizzes take hours to complete and the homework doesn't line up with the current material being taught.",
      "Professor Mitra gets a bad rep but to be honest it's mostly because CSE220 is a very difficult class no matter who teaches it. He's knowledgeable and fairly good at explaining the concepts in class. Attendance is optional and lectures are recorded and HW uses GitHub classroom so you can always know if your work is correct or not, which is awesome.",
      "The only reason I was able to keep up with what's going on in this class was because it was ASYNCHRONUS. I was literally skipping this class to do the homework for this class. Comparing Mitra and Kmac's lectures/slides, it's almost as if Mitra was only going over the easy examples. He doesn't go over the harder stuff that's shows up on the test.",
      "Don't take him if you don't have to. Frequent quizzes, and the tests are ridiculously hard. Test questions are overly complex, the average for our midterm was a 60. Homeworks are in MIPS and are assigned almost back to back so you never get a break.",
      "Bad at explaining things. Worst class I've ever taken by a large amount. Better to self-learn.",

Thinks it's completely reasonable to memorize very specific things(regex addict). median for the final exam was around 60, & he barely curved it. I got near-perfect scores on homework but didn't even get a B- because of the ridiculous quizzes and final. Do not take him",

Still doesn't change the fact that his quizzes were unfairly difficult and plagued with typos tho. He is a good lecturer however, and considering this is his first semester teaching, he may improve in the future. Take at your own risk."

      "The worst professor and advisor to exist. Her whole existence is built to pull students down. I hope she realizes how much negative impact she made on our lives.",
      "She is awful and not a very good professor on top of that.   Very disorganized and dismissive of students.",
      "This online class is easy, that's clear. The quality of the professor is HORRENDOUS. I visited her office hours expecting to be treated with RESPECT. She made me wait 20 minutes while she gossiped with her friends and then was rude to me, yelled at me every time I asked a question, and did not look at my face. I am so angry at how I was treated.",
      "The entire semester was a breeze with weekly one page essays and online quizzes. There was a final case study project worth 30% of the final grade which I got a 100 on. Overall I had a 95.74 average WENSLE(even with a 0 factored in for one week I skipped an essay) but she gave me an A- until i handed it in & said she couldn't  find my extra credit.",
      "She actually cares about helping you succeeded.  Very understanding if you have explain your situation and will work with you to figure something out. Rita is approachable and always is in her office with the door open with students constantly coming in and out. Her class's is decent amount of work but very manageable if you don't procrastinate.",
      "Expect an online quiz and written assignment every week.  Both are simple, and she is a lenient grader.  Must buy the textbook to do well.  HOWEVER, the final assignment has very little to do with the semester's material- a 5 page case study on a business that she must approve. Other than the final assignment, it is an easy upper division DEC.",
      "This woman may honestly be the kindest and most considerate professor I have ever had. Her understanding literally saved my college career and over a grand. I couldn't be anything but eternally thankful.",
      "Took this online for a DEC, super easy. There's a discussionassignment due every week but they are graded easily, some I put no effort into and always got full credit. The tests are straight from the textbook and you can take them over if you do poorly. The final is a case study that is really tough, but I'd still recommend this class.",
      "Had an online quiz and a homework due once a week but other than that no work. Inclass assignment usually due the  day after class and were only a few questions.  My class met once a week and it was by far my easiest class that semester(got an A). NO FINAL. only a e-portfolio which was nbd.",
      "This class had a lot of nonsense busy work. Nothing was difficult, just time consuming and extremely boring. I went to class, did well on all the quizzes, and got 100 on the final project/paper and somehow ended up with a B+. I tried e-mailing her about it, but she ignored it. I definitely would not recommend this class.",
      "I agree with the comments below. It seems she expects everyone to make the class their most important one ! ( 60 dollar clicker mandatory)  It takes at least 3 hours to get the HW done all of it which is common sense. Lectures are not engaging. Runs the class very messy, rushes us to get class work done in 10 mins and still a bad grade ! Avoid !",
      "MOST UNORGANIZED & UNINTERESTED PROFESSOR EVER. She was unprepared for every lecture. Told the entire class that she hated the text book on the first day. Took months to give HW grades and let the TA grade an essay which (surprise!) turned into the final bc she was lazy. I took this class for my job, but learned nothing. Waste of time and money.",
      "Worst professor ever! The professor is unorganized and  she cannot teach. She expects everyone to do the homework when it is very challenging; the homeworks are nothing like the lectures. Do not take this class for a dec. It was a complete waste of time.",
      "She treated this class as an online course and I saw no reason to go to lecture.  You need a laptop for this class, homeworks and classwork was multiple choice on blackboard, there were often wrong answers in them as you could see from the book and we would protest the grades.  The final was a take home final and it was insane.",
      "EASY A! The lecturer is too trusting. I gave several excuses for not completing work and I got 4 seperate extensions. Needs to have better structure. IF anyone takes this in the spring just tell her it never came in the mail and she'll give you several extensions.",
      "Boring lecturer, but easy A. Makes her undergard TAs teach for her sometimes. Also has guest lecturers. They were good. Nice lady though.",
      "Good teacher.  Likes students. Very helpful",
      "Microsoft Office portion of class is super easy and helpful. The reason people do bad is they try to be creative during open assignments. If you just do the required hw you can easily get an A like I will.",
      "Nice class, meets once a week.",
      "She is very nICe trys hard to help students and assist when possible",
      "I was extremely dissapointed with this class due to the Lack of preparation, courtesy and committment of this teacher. She severly lacked any understanding regarding what real teachers do in a classroom,and yet had the audacity to ridicule & judge the students when they didn't meet her expectations,even though they were never clearly communicated"

He's consistently made mistakes in lectures, given poor assignments (one which was so bad he admitted it was \"not as good as he hoped\"), and is all around unhelpful. He is unprofessional. Don't take his class if you don't know the material, you will be misled.",
      "Wanted to take CSE373 with him so bad but didn't get a chance, just watched all his lectures on Youtube. Taught me Algorithms and Data Structures, wrote the Algorithm Design Manual, just a overall legend. My favorite professor of all time.",
      "Pretty good professor, had a lot of fun learning in this class. Material can be challenging.",
      "Great Professor, has informative lectures on interesting course material. The textbook is very helpful for preparing for exams and homeworks, and while the course is difficult, it feels rewarding to solve a problem that you had previously had no grasp on. The professor curves well and is fair with grading. Highly recommend!",
      "He cares about the students. The median in the class is B and the average grade a person would get in his midterm is 60 or less. This class is really tough. Be prepared for what he is teaching.",
      "The lectures are awesome, and he assigns grades quite generously. But be aware, if you know little about machine learning beforehand, you will spend substantial amounts of time on hw and project. For students planning to take 519, plz be respectful and attend lectures at lea! There are so many shadiao students who are irresponsible this semester.",
      "Everything is just a little bit so don't expect much from lectures to make you good at data science. Another thing i would like to mention is that during final exam, when I saw something unclear in the questions, the professor just said, \"Read the Question\" and just ignored me. This is very rude so anyone consider taking the course, beware...",
      "I chose his course because he teaches data science, which is a hot topic. He is good at teaching and explain things well. The slides are very accessible and you can find a lot of useful information on his course website. The homework and project are not easy, but you will learn a lot if you do them seriously.",
      "He teaches very well. But it is impossible to talk with him in person. He forgets what he says and doesn't understand your work. The project has high impact on the final score, so be careful in choosing project topic.",
      "Really interesting prof, and this course is really hard... If you want a better GPA, be careful to choose his CSE373",
      "People line up for Skiena's class for a reason. His talk is always funny in a way that I really like, and not only he is a great and humorous lecturer but also a very nice and caring person. Among all the classes I have taken this semester, his class is definitely the best.",
      "What a cutie. My fave class so far. Fair grader with curve. Interesting lectures, textbook is also entertaining. 1010",
      "Took Data Science under Prof Skiena. Learnt a lot, got a chance to do videos for our project and made meaningful predictions of real world problems. Loved it!",
      "Amazing Professor!",
      "Amazing",
      "I don't think the material in 373 could be made easy (especially the second half), but Skiena makes it much more interesting! Just read the textbook, do the HW problems and complete as many exercise problems as you can before the exams and you should do fine.",
      "Definitely not an easy class. In fact, if you take this with another professor, you'll have a harder time. Skiena provides the best explanations there is for algorithms. You will learn the concepts very quickly. The midterms were very tough, but related to his textbook questions. You should take 373 with Skiena!",
      "Awesome guy! If you're at SUNY Stony Brook, you MUST take a class under him!",
      "This is the hardest class I ever took beside PHY132. Textbook is useless to study from and lectures are horrible. You either get the material or you don't.",
      "Great professor, very funny and enthusiastic. Makes learning algorithms fun. The class is quite difficult but Skiena makes it much easier to understand, best professor to take Algorithms with.",
      "Best Professor for Algorithm...He explained thing really clear. He is a funny, nice and smart !!!  I learned a lot from him....the materials and the text book are extremely useful...",
      "Excellent professor, balances material for both inexperienced and experienced algorists. Has a number of signifigant research projects,(ie, frist touchpad etc..). Well known algorist.",

      "Fair. This is the word that best describes professor Esmaili. I took him twice. First semester was in person he gave tough midterm papers and final exams, I felt really demoralized after that final exam (score: D- uncurved, B- curved). Second semester was online over summer. I tried much harder, aced every homework (score: B uncurved, A+ curved).",
      "Very strict and even if it is not his intention, the course is designed to fail people out of the program. HW are basically mini-projects and the tests are filled with weird counting questions. I can imagine this would be very troublesome for people without a lot of experience coding. For a low level cs class, this was disappointing and excessive.",
      "I would say his grading/HW/exams are mostly fair, his lectures aren't the most captivating but he does a decent job explaining the concepts. Generally has a pretty good email response rate. Also take care to show that you are not cheating because he is very cautious about that.",
      "Overall great professor if you want to learn about data structures. Very good in explanation and reasoning. HWs are pretty long and difficult but teach you how to implement data structures. Make sure you start the HW as soon as it is posted and review recitation questions and complete all review tests prior to exams and you are guaranteed an A.",
      "The whole CS department will die if this is how CS is taught: made the homework extra difficult that didn't use the data structures taught, and then the exam and recitation followed time complexity stuff that the homework never really focused on. All in all, the components of the class didn't meld well enough.",
      "He is the most outstanding professor you could have for CSE214. GOAT.",
      "Pretty good and knowledgeable professor. Grades quickly; we got our final exam grades 5 hours after the exam finished. Homeworks were long, but do improve your skills as a programmer. He doesn't post notes and gives pop quizzes. If you miss a lecture, there's little to no way to find out what you missed since the slides barely give info.",
      "Esmaili is a good lecturer and I learned a ton in his class. However, his course slides show little information and can be vague. There were also lots of Homework assignments but I found them pretty fun.",
      "Professor Esmaili was definitely a tough professor for CSE214, although you do learn a lot. It's important to attend lectures, otherwise, you'll find it extremely difficult to do the homework assignments, which are basically projects given every other week (you have 2 weeks to complete each one). The midterm and final is worth a lot so study hard!",
      "Esmaili is pretty good at the material you need to learn about data structures and algorithms, but you definitely have to work in order to do well in the class. The class is ranked, which means there will always be the bottom percentage of the class that fails, but hes still good with his teaching. Study hard!",
      "Besides no support during course, he is not even a good enough ISE program director. Doesn't support students. Complicates things for them for no reason. Very mean.",
      "One of the best professors I have had so far at Stony. Very approachable through email, he typically replied within a few minutes and was always keen on making sure that the student understands. He always says don't go after the grade, try to understand the material, and I definitely agree! Try to understand the material, the grade will come.",
      "Worst professor I've ever had at Stony. Every semester, there is a scandal of him accusing innocent students of cheating when it was his fault. (Posting two exam links in different folders where one of them is recorded and the other one isn't and expecting us to only take one of them without telling us which one). Barely replies to emails/piazza.",
      "Do not take Esmaili if it isn't for CSE214. I've heard he's good for that class, but in my experience in his 311 and 215 course, he's the worst prof I've had at Stony. Unempathetic, clearly doesn't care about the material or students, trails off and \"finishes\" explaining things by going \"So... yeah.\" Any learning I did in this course, I did myself.",
      "Great Professor, tests are fairly easy because of curve, show up in class for pop quizzes tho. He gives multiple a year and seems to follow a pattern with when he gives them but shakes things up randomly. He's also a tryhard when it comes to stopping people from cheating.",
      "Be aware of red-black tree questions on the final!",
      "He is a good professor but be prepared to put in time for his HWs that are due every two weeks(Start early). His tests are pretty similar to the practice tests that he will give so make sure you learn how to do every question in them. Youll come out of this class with a strong understanding of the material if you put in the work.",
      "Good and funny professor overall. If you have CS background before college then it's an easy A. My friend unbelievably received A who had been taken lots of points on midterm and final with a lot of imperfect HW grades. This class is the final trial to see if you can continue this major. He does give many students a hard time for HW assignments tho",
      "The best teacher you can have for 214. The class can be challenging, but the material in it is fundamental to the rest of CS. He offers extra credit, where if you do it all he will bump up your grade one letter. He's also really nice and he takes questions during class. Would definitely recommend to take him for 214 if possible.",
      "The class had 7 home works that were due every other week. In addition to that, even though you do great in the first and second midterm, but do badly in the final, you can still get a good enough grade. He explains the material very well.",
      "This class is a bit intimidating but Esmaili genuinely cares for his students and wants to see people succeed, and while his tests are difficult, he doesn't really throw any curve balls. He's a good choice for 214",
      "He's very knowledgeable in his field and clearly knows what he's talking about, but he's not that great at explaining things sometimes. He goes fast sometimes and his tests can be very difficult. He is accessible in his office hours and will do his best to answer questions in class though.",
      "Unlike CSE 114, The material from the lecture and textbook do not correspond with each other, so you need to show up to class to actually learn the material. He tried to make the lectures discussion-based and guess what, no one participates. Wish the lecture slides were more clear so we don't need to fill in those missing gaps.",
      "Exams are fair and he mostly tests you on the theory behind each data structure (usually only 1-2 coding problems). He gives pop quizzes, but they're pretty easy and are mostly there to check for attendance. Do all of the homework assignments; you will learn a lot from them. Esmaili is a very nice guy and he listens to feedback from students.",
      "Lectures are decent, he just goes over the Power Point but gives extra detail and good tips. Tests are more about the theory than application so you won't have to hand-write code much which is great. Homeworks are long but overall not that hard. Start them early and try to do the extra credit portions. Recommended.",
      "Great Professor. His lectures are clear and he is very responsive to emails. Attendance isnt mandatory but he sometimes says what will be on the test.  There was a total of 7 hw and doing them help in understanding the material.  He also gives you a rank so you can know your grade at that point in the semester.",
      "He hasn't taught 215 in a while but he does know what he is doing. You don't have to attend lecture besides the occasional pop quiz but it's only worth a few percent of your grade. If you do all the homework, the tests would be fairly easy. I would recommend him if you want a light 215 class if he ever teaches it again.",
      "So, there were two groups of people in the class: pro-hackers and students with no  cse background at all. It seemed that Esmaili assumed that everyone had background and class was taught in such manner. He is very detail-specific at tests and will ask something non-common. Most people didn't have time to finish midterm(50mins) and average was 60.",
      "I decided to take class with this professor because I heard good things. However, when taking the class I was faced with a lot of very picky grading that didn't make any sense. He also falsely accused me of academic dishonesty, and even though he admitted I didn't do anything wrong, still gave me a 0 for the assignment. Others have similar stories.",
      "Had him for 214, 305 and 311. He's a good prof, learned a lot in 214 and 305 (214 is hard,305 is pretty easy). Classes are always MWF which is a pain. Most recently had him for 311, was his first time doing this class and it showed, the class was very disorganized. Hopefully he cleans it up if he teaches it again, because he's a very capable prof.",
      "My favorite professor when I was here. He was tough and I learned a lot. Lectures and expectations were very clear and easy to follow. He offers extra credit with every assignment, which I strongly recommend if you have time since they really helped me learn (given I took the course over the summer - free time to work on this course)",
      "Took the class 2 yrs ago. Easy course, but there is no curving, so you have to be perfect to get a good grade! He does NOT relax the grading. More important is the fact that his stuff is really outdated. Not at all helpful for advanced classes you want to take later. Also, he doesn't help you with Java concepts if they are not directly in syllabus!",
      "Enjoyable professor for 214. Great projects that had solid use of other libraries and beat you in the face with object oriented design. Taught data structures well. For 311, this is his first semester teaching it and it's a mess. Lab days with no warning, a lot of time spent on topics not really related to Linux sys admin. Not too useful a course.",
      "This professor, while not the worst professor I have had, was very unhelpful in my situation in his class. Possible you wont finish exams. The HW is crucial. I cant stress that enough. However, they can be very difficult. I received a 50/100, 70/100, and 105/160 on the three exams and got a D because my HW avg was a 58 (I did all 8 for the record)",
      "I took CSE102 which was a joke class, but he was alright teaching it",
      "Very nice professor, though you should expect ALOT of work from his classes. Most of the homework is fairly straight forward, but it does require alot of time to work on. Tests are fair, but definitely not easy. I've had far worser professors, so that's great for those that must take CSE 214.",
      "Cool dude. Accent may be a slight inconvenience but you get used to it. He's very helpful if you have questions.",
      "Esmaili is a great middle man professor. He doesn't exactly offer any unique spin to the class, but he clearly explains fundamental CS principles. Very by the numbers. Pop quizzes are very sporadicannoying. Homework & practice tests are crucial. Don't challenge him on anything, unless you are ready to fight. His arrogance precedes him.",
      "Took CSE230 and 214 with him. Super clear professor who actually TEACHES you the material. Answers a lot of question. His practice exams are identical to the midterms. His Finals are sort of killer since he expects you to know a lot. I got a B in the class when I got 100 on most of the hw and did mediocre on the exams. DO ALL THE HW's!",
      "Isn't hard, but tedious hw.  Gives you 2 weeks to do it but sometimes you need all of the 2 weeks to finish it.  TAs are helpful and his tests are way easier than 114, still have to study tho.  Very difficult to get an A in this class because he grades based on rank and there are people there who are pro coders.  Overall fun class and u learn alot",
      "If you are not familiar with Java, have never used it before, DO NOT take his 214 class. He's always there to help you as well as the TA's. He's very nice. He's VERY strict and if you don't follow his rules, it won't end well for you. Do the HW's ASAP, study for the class (and if you're new to Java, you need to study like a machine) and you're ok.",
      "His lectures aren't bad. I went to his office hours a few times and he was pretty helpful. His HW assignments were not difficult at all and you have plenty of time to do them. He gives pop quizs in class so you have to show up.",
      "Prof. Esmaili is one of the best professors I've had. I am not CSE major and actually took his intermediate programming class without first taking the introductory class however, his clearness and way of teaching had made me learn very fast.",
      "Nice teaching",
      "Many students spread nonsensical rumour about Professor Esamaili. He is one of the best professor in CS dep and knows his stuff.",
      "Excellent Professor; absolutely knows his stuff.   With effort, C can be learned; EXCELLENT class for someone with no programming background.  But be warned, assignments are time consuming and you must start early.  Esmaili is very willing to help out during office hours.  Also, you do not learn C in much depth, take CSE 230 for that.  Subtle jokes",
      "I like professor Esmaili. He is nice and helpful",
      "Go to class and pay attention not all of the slides are online and some contain errors, some of the info only covered verbally in lecture are  in the text. Pay attention, plan your asignments out, do all the practice questions, and do the extra credit. Show him you are trying. As long as you try hard you will survive.",
      "Greatest Professor at Stony Brook. Tests can be tough if you don't study hard enough though. Don't buy the textbook, I didn't even open it and still got a B+ in this class.",
      "He's a very irritating professor. He goes through material at an extremely slow pace, but then rushes through examples, without giving you a chance to think. You will learn a lot from the class, but not from him. He's also very monotonic, you will not pay attention, but attendance is mandatory.  Honestly, it's an easy A class regardless."

      "The exam imposes time constraints, so to excel, it is essential to devote time practicing each problem in the assignments,previous midterms,practice midterms,hw/classwork problems multiple times, particularly a few days before the exam to easily score an A as the questions are similar with a good probability.",
      "One of the best professors",
      "Probability is a complicated topic but the professor simplifies it very well. The stat part was good too. It is an introductory course which is a must if you haven't taken a probability course before. Although professor had frequent office hours, at least one TA should hold regular office hours to help students with assignments.",
      "He teaches easy concept in class but requires difficult ones in homework and tests. Be ware of the term project, we've done everything he asked for and still got a bad grade. His \"Class interaction\" is a mysterious part of grading, I signed the only signing in in class and attended every single other classes but still lose credit to it.",
      "This teacher's homework is not close to the level of knowledge taught in class, and always take away points on trivial things. The grading of the final project(30%) and what's called \"Class interaction\" are complete black boxes. He made decisions without specified rules and we don't even know how we loss our points. Don't select his class",
      "He is very organized and sticks to the class schedule that he posts at the beginning of the semester. The course is divided into 3 sections - probability review, statistics, and regression. The problems in the assignment are thought-provoking and extend some of the concepts taught in the lecture. Only downside - project group size(minimum 5).",
      "Prof Gandhi is really really patient and kind person. If you have any question, just ask for him, he always can explain your question in a easy understanding way. Even though the course is hard, but I think I have learnt a lot",
      "Gandhi is a phenomenal professor and lecturer. He's exceptionally clear in his thought and can convey complex ideas effectively. I honestly was very impressed by the guy and hope he continues to teach undergrad courses. Very helpful in his office, poor guy had to have like 10 extra OHs. Very inspirational tbh, honestly best prof I've ever had.",
      "His classes are fun. Encourages questions. This makes some students ask really stupid questions but it is good in a way that students are no longer afraid of asking questions. The difficulty of the course definitely needs to increase, so does the depth of topics covered. Don't take project lightly, he doesn't. A good one overall.",
      "He's amazing. His class is fun and interactive. He starts from the very scratch so everyone gets it. A lot of paper readings, but after the first few you'll get acqainted to the content."

      "Best instructor in the program. Genuinely wants students to succeed. You need to work, no  patience for lazy students.",
      "very impatient,cant argue with him. Use a weird server node for upload HW but only teach once. Went to office hour to ask how to compile on the node but only thing I got was shouting \"I already tough in class\". Therefore HW grade was low becuz cant test on server, even though I did the HW. Quiz is OK but midterm and final are real tricky.",
      "He is a horrible,impatient  professor. If you argue about the grade(quiz, project or exam) in his office hour, he will shout at you. Can't believe school will hire someone like him.",
      "I pegged him wrong from the beginning.  His bark is worse that his bite.  Knows his stuff really well, clarifies everyhthing, exams are hard, but if you work hard, it is not a problem.  He really wants you to learn, prepares you for the real world.  Outstanding professor.",
      "One of the very important class. This professor means good and is helpful but his teaching style is hard to understand.  Class is very hard so pay attention.",
      "Very helpful professor. He seems little bit strict in the beginning of class but if you pay attention to him and consistent on your study, he understands you and make every effort to help you. Getting good grade is not hard if you do regular assignments and study.",
      "This guy knows his stuff. Class will seem boring because he talks fast but go to his office hours and just read the chapters he assigns and you'll be good for the exams, quizzess and projects",
      "He is impatient. He will not welcome you to ask him questions, if you take too much time, he will shout at you. Most of the students got confused on his course. For those who got good grades, they retake this course. This is a very important course, do not take his course, otherwise you have study all by yourself alone and get a poor grade.",
      "Boring class. But he obviously loves the stuff. Easy grade too. If you do the work.",
      "A very genuine person, treats the students as his children. He helped me a lot. He has a specific way of speaking and if you do not understand it, sometimes you'd think he is annoyed or quirky. I had the same feeling when I started working with him but slowly I understood. Works very hard himself on student projects. I owe my graduation to him.",
      "this is where i really learned about network protocols, he really knows this field, and he is very funny",
      "This is HIS field so he knows his stuff. A great teacher, but the way the class is taught is flawed. Projects a breeze, but he makes the quizzes and tests unnecessarily specific and tricky. You can completely understand the material yet do only \"average\" on a test. Occasionally moody; don't ask unnecessary questions. You'll learn a lot in this clas",
      "He posts lectures and practice exams online but they're difficult to understand without going to lectures. He's very good at teaching and as long as you're paying some attention, grasping the material should be easy. His tests aren't very difficult, similar to the practice exam. He's not an easy A, but a little effort will go a long way.",
      "Easy professor. You have all the previous exams which is completely the same as the actual mid-term. But you have to be on your own for final as there is no practice exams at all for the final.",
      "He's interesting. He provides a lot of information, but it's hard to understand without going through class. His lecture slides often have mistakes in them that he corrects in class. Don't expect to learn the material by yourself. His tests are not difficult if you know what you're doing, but not many people do. The TA did a better job teaching.",
      "His knowledge levels are incredible. He does get tensed a lot of times. But for someone who has so much in his head, I think it's acceptable. His expectations are not sky high and he doesn't believe in using the whip at all. All in all, he's one of the best guys around in Stony Brook. Working with him is a pleasurable experience.",
      "He's a fair grader. Easy A... if you do the work and study.",
      "The Best!",
      "Horrible prof. Avoid.",
      "He just took over 220 from Pawagi and seems to have taken a lot of his stuff so I'm not sure if some of the problems are from him or from Pawagi, he's a little emotion but an overall ok teacher, the programs are ok, but the tests have strange wording and aren't always clear, you literally have to memorize the textbook.",
      "Bad teacher, moody and got no patience. Don't ever ask a question since he might behead you. Good luck on 220 suckers.",
      "Fair professor. Funny when he gets mad. Accent is interesting.",

      "Too much theory in the class. The lecture and the notes were very ambiguous so I relied on searching the entire semester. The textbook he suggests we read is non-existent and even after finding it, it is unhelpful. The worst part is the programming - the starting requirement is very long and changes are made in every iteration of the project.",
      "HE HAS A CAT AND A DOG 10/10 WOULD TAKE AGAIN",
      "Terrible at lecture. Makes things so unnecessarily complicated. He has the knack of introducing simply concepts as something riddiculously complex. Pretty sure if you are to ask him to teach simply arithmetic like what 1 + 1 equals to, he will do it in a way that will buffle and confused a college student.",
      "He might be a good professor in research, but he is definitely the worst professor at teaching.",
      "Lecture and assignment are all ambiguous",
      "He is a great professor. I learned a lot from his class and his office hour. I got a job offer because of the knowledge that he taghut me. His attitude is condescending towards student sometimes, but if you bear with him and apply yourself, you will learn a lot.",
      "His teaching is mostly by rote and his grading criteria are very rigid (especially for the course project). He can be very condescending professor in his office hours and will basically tell you to shut up if you're even remotely trying to argue with him. Ridiculously bad attitude towards students who actually want to learn.",
      "Worst professor ever, terrible teacher",
      "Does a poor job explaining concepts in class and is condescending when you ask him questions. His projects and announcements are copied from previous semesters, complete with same typos. The class has little to do with the project. He never fails to mention that Prof. Kiefer made his slides. He mentions errors on them but never bothers to fix them.",
      "He's useless. Read the textbook instead of going to class. questions are encouraged in class, but he always interrupts, and can't explain. over complicates simple things. He's absolutely useless.",
      "Avoid",
      "One of the worst computer science courses in Stony Brook University. Final Project is very time consuming and is only worth 10% of your grade. Midterm and stupid final determine everything.",
      "Scott is a terrible professor who can not teach well. He is always asking the class questions about how to solve the problems because he does not want to \"spoonfeed\" us lecture notesanswers. I would rather have him \"spoonfeed\" us lecture notes. Halfway through lecture, he either corrects himself or just pauses, making it very hard to concentrate.",
      "Scott Smolka is the worst Computer Science professor in Stony Brook. He is very vague on the project requirements. If you go to him for help, he will tell you to read the textbook. The textbook itself is a hard read. The final is a nightmare. He teaches theory poorly, does not teach anything that pertains to the project.",
      "CSE 305 is either terribly structured, or terribly taught.   If you take this class, read the book. Don't go by the slides or the professor, both are somewhat useless.  The project may as well be completely separate from the class's content (SQL omitted), and will lead to a lot of confusion. I hope this class improves.",
      "He tries to go by memory at the start of the lecture before even leaving the title slide, then skips through the slides as fast as possible, correcting the mistakes he made on the whiteboard. Vague project descriptions, directs all questions to TA. He is also condescending to people who participate in class, to the point where most are discouraged.",
      "305 is two courses built into one course. Smolka teaches you the theory of the course while the TA handles the  programming aspect of the course and after the first two project assignments, there's almost no overlap between the two. The second half of the class is all theory and the final exam average is usually in the 40's. project is 308 project",
      "Guys... He is seem to be easy going. I am glad I have a good leader in my group.",
      "Prepared to work a lot of hours on this class. The project is insanely huge and there's so little time given to complete it. The final exam is ridiculously hard, but do-able. I put in a lot of effort for an A, and I did the majority of the work in my group. Really recommended that you take CSE 336 before this class.",
      "He doesn't teach anything useful at all,not clear on project, very lazy professor.",
      "The material in class is not difficult but he cannot teach the material. He goes over more on theory in class and the Project is application. His project is very ambiguous and he grades it on some specification he will not say. His project description are copy and paste of last semester and does not make sense to the purpose of the project.",
      "His lectures are very dry... didn't go to the last half of them, his project specs (as specified earlier) are very dim and do not meet all his expectations come final project demo, but the class teaches you a lot... oh and dont be concerned about low test grades.. avg on the final was a 42",
      "Yes, his lectures are pretty much worse than watching paint dry. Yes, his project specifications are really befuddling and end up not covering everything he actually wants. But, the class is worth it and you do learn what you have to learn. Grading is very very fair. Don't be intimidated.",
      "I dont think he knows any subject at all. He is a confused lot. Redirects all the doubts to TA or some other person.",
      "It is OK whether a prof. is arrogant or not; however, if he does not know about his assignment and always is confused by himself, this must a big problem. His every assignment spec. has full of fallacies and he does not know in spite of many objections raised by students. Also his grading is constroversial and unacceptable.",
      "TAKE CSE 336 AS A CO-REQ OR PRE-REQ OR TAKE THIS COURSE WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS (and that you'll partner with). HWs are easy and midterm is as well. The final is dubbed: \"the hardest test in the CS department\", though I disagree. It is hard though, so study for that. Generous grader; do well on project and you're in great running for an A.",
      "Strongly recommend you to take Internet programming before take this class with him. Cuz the help he gives for the project was outdated, and unclear. Strongly recommend you to buy a textbook and read every single word, and try to memorize them. Don't need to attend class his lecture is unorganized, and he is really testing you from the book.",
      "His teaching is good and is a fair grader. However for those who said he explains everything, good for you. Whenever I ask him questions he replied with a mean attitude. I did nothing but to ask him to clarify some parts of his project assignments that seems contradictive. Project solutions does not comply with the project specification.",
      "Advisable to take internet programming before this class. grading is fair. Last part of project was hard, it was all internet programming. The after doing this project software engineering course is a breeze. you have to concentrate to understand.He tries hard to make us understand stuff.Make sure you know what you are talking before you go to him."

      "The greatest class and professor I've ever taken. If you want to be a software developer then this is the most relevant course you can take at SBU.I got a software development internship for the summer because of the knowledge i gained from this course,i can't overstate the usefulness of it. Sad that it won't be offered in the next few semesters :(",
      "No one chats during his lectures because they are so interesting and every knowledge point he talks will become a hw. Prepare to have 3 dues in 7 days. Try no to take other CSE courses that have final projects at the same time. After all, he is the best professor ever.",
      "The material laid out in the class is so relevant to the industry and very up-to-date with what's hot. The course focuses mainly on creating a project based on the technologies discussed and taught in class to the point where it's sad that more classes do not resemble it. I may have gotten a poor grade, but I will never regret having had taken it.",
      "Mike Ferdman is hands down one of the best professors I have had the pleasure of taking a class with here. Cloud computing is probably one of, if not the most, important course I've taken here, despite it being an elective. Although you don't have to technically attend lecture to do well, it would really help, especially if you came in knowing 0.",
      "No hand holding here! You will learn a lot. Cloud computing was one of the toughest and most rewarding classes. It's a hot topic in the industry and is a very interesting and fun one too. You will learn cloud architectural design concepts and get to build a system of your own. You will use technologies industries use so this is a very sought class",
      "There really ought to be more classes like this one at SBU. The amount of relevance of this class with the tech industry is unbelievable, and I enjoyed every byte of difficulty this class had to offer. Great class if you want a focus on projects rather than tests. Also the professor is a good lecturer, just be ready to pay attention.",
      "A rockstar professor. His lectures are charming and educative at the same time. He is always active on piazza and is very knowledgeable.",
      "He is amazing Professor. His 506 is one of the toughest in SBU, but you will feel the worth after completing the course.",
      "Operating Systems under Prof. Mike Ferdman is the best course offered at SBU. I audited the course and learned a lot. Best way to learn OS is by building it and Prof. Mike's focus is on that only. I regret not being enrolled in the course. Hopefully, he offers the course in Fall '18 and I will surely enroll.",
      "If you are interested in Systems, Computer Architecture under Mike is a must take course. Professor is accessible; replies to mails within minutes. Easily one of the best and hardest course project (we built a RISCV processor). Don't take this with other hard courses.",
      "Easily the most relevant cs course offered at Stony Brook. Everything you could ever want to know about scalable cloud-based systems, Prof. Ferdman has right at his fingertips. Attendance was not mandatory, but the knowledge he offers in his lectures made me want to come and listen. Course projects and hws were difficult, but rewarding.",
      "This course is hard and time-consuming. But, it is the most useful one. Prof. Ferdman is very experienced and skillful in Cloud Computing field. The course covers many hot topics. But, it's hard to get reliable materials to read, which makes this course hard. Take it if you want to be more prepared for your future career.",
      "Professor Ferdman is a wizard when it comes to systems, architecture, and cloud computing (probably many more stuff). We went over so much and professor Ferdman even gave us access to use his own cloud as well as access to free AWS accounts! If you want to build a startup take this course.  Must takes at SBU CSE 356, CSE 502, CSE 506.",
      "Most amazing prof at Stony Brook. his class are must take.  Projects are super heavy and requires substantial efforts. But i can confidently say, i owe a great deal to him and learning at his truly prepared me for real world. After his class, interviews will sound like cake",
      "391 was cloud computing & easily one of the best classes/profs I've taken. Ferdman's teaching style is amazing and he knows how to keep you interested. He answers emails within minutes, even at 2 am. His assignments are very difficult and open ended. Unlike many classes, the majority of the grade is project. I wish he taught more undergrad courses.",
      "Ferdman is the smartest professor I've had at Stony Brook. His lectures clear and interesting. He's available basically 24/7 on Piazza.. His assignments are INCREDIBLY difficult and require lots of self learning, but you will learn so much by completing them. I'm certain that without his class I wouldn't have the opportunities I do today.",
      "one of the best courses that I have ever taken, If you want to design and implement an operating system from the scratch, then u should totally consider taking it.",
      "If you are interested in core systems side then his CSE 506(Grad OS) and CSE 502(Comp Arch) are must takes at SBU. I was lucky enough to take courses offered by him and work in his Lab (COMPAS). You will learn everything by doing the course project which is mandatory and really tough and will thank him for the rest of your life for what you learned",

      "Prof Ferdman is the best prof in Stony Brook, if you are coming to stony brook and you dont plan to take his course, dont come here. His course is tough but you learn more from him than anyone else. He is always available in office hours and this is one of the few courses that values hard work. Trust me , take OS and you will love it.",
      "He is a great professor, and really knows how to teach. He is also very helpful. His course project is very open-ended and challenging, but because of that, I think I've understood concepts in the subject very well. I think he is one of the best professors I've had.",
      "One of the best professor at Stony Brook. If you really want to learn OS, go for his class. He's very helpful and readily available for help. This class has been the best class that I have ever attended.",
      "His grading policy is different but relieves you of irritating deadlines. Classes are interesting but learnt a lot more from Project! He does not spoon feed,so be cautious of taking the course if you don't have a proper background/coding proficiency or willingness to work really hard. But he is very helpful. Handsome and fun too ;)",
      "The best prof at SBU if you want to learn about systems. His comp arch and OS courses are highly recommended.",
      "He is one of the best Prof I have ever met. His projects are so good that makes the concepts etched in our heads. I highly recommend taking his course. He helps a lot in the form of Office hours, mailing lists etc. He even replies to doubts at 3am in the morning. What else does a student need from a Professor. In short, \"The best Prof\"",
      "One of the awesome professor. If you really wanted to learn OS and ready to work hard go for it.",
      "Ferdman is one of the bestest professor I've seen. His lectures are always interesting to attend, though I agree, he does teach from slides and doesn't use the blackboard much. He more than makes up for it during the office hours and on the online forum. He is super, super helpful. It's a pleasure taking this class with him.",
      "I'm currently enrolled in CSE506. I feel that his teaching isn't easy to follow. He tends to rush through concepts which are difficult, but spend more time on the easier ones. He reviewed undergrad OS theory for weeks, but rushed through multiprocessor systems. Also he teaches from slides and doesn't use the blackboard. You might not like that.",
      "The best professor in Stony Brook. He knows OS and Comp arch in and out and is one of the most friendly profs out there. Though the classes are not mandatory, I always regret whenever I don't attend them. Learning a lot from implementing a real OS. The only gripe is that he doesn't give milestones, which I believe is very important."

She always wants us to post a question on piazza and she replies with one line answer which is so vague. \n\nAlso there's no electronic device policy which is against the constitution.",
      "Midterm was extremely long which in my opinion is just a poor designation of an exam, especially since she knowingly knew it was long. Programming assignments are tedious due to the restrictions on libraries and structures we're allowed to use. Lectures are boring. No phones/laptops in class which for a computer science class makes no sense.",
      "She's such a nice professor and her lectures are very informative as someone who didn't know much about networking beforehand. I'm not sure if I would enjoy this class if it weren't for her. That being said, yes she has a no laptop policy in the class (she will call you out on it and tell you to put it away) and her homeworks can be ambiguous.",

Her course is quite interactive. Apart from giving lectures on traditional topics, she gives lectures on cutting-edge network research topics.",
      "She is a very rude professor. She does not know the subject material well, and instead of answering student questions, she just shouts at students. Do not take this class if you want to learn fundamentals of networking at a graduate level. It is really not worth your time and money. She also gives final grade projects randomly.",
      "Amazing professor. She has the best systems course at Stony brook.",
      "Very nice professor and generous as anything ! She tries to put a lot of effort in her course. Also, she has updated her course to latest industry tech and that makes it a lot more interesting !",
      "awful class. the key problem is that she always  asks students to say out the important knowledge key point, and she only says:'exactly !'. So if you miss or don't understand the student's answer, you are missing this key point. and also, the slide is brief and rough, a lot of details she just mentioned a little in class, but will be included exam",
      "Prof. Aruna helps students in all possible ways. Always, make sure to attend her lecture. It really helps you following the course.  She is strict with deadlines, but overall very reasonable.",
      "One of the worst professors at SBU. She's hopeless. Discourages students from asking questions in class. An excerpt-  Student: Could you repeat what you just explained? I did not quite catch it She: Obviously, I'm not going to repeat it ! Not helpful either outside the class or on the discussion forum and doesn't allow anonymity.",
      "Not useful at all. Not worth the advanced course. Grader/grading is poor. Not approachable outside the class. Does not help clarify the doubts as she is not good in networking. Covers only application layer aspects in class.",
      "Her assignments are not scaled to the level she teaches. The good thing is that she doesn't have a monotonous sound -keeps you alive in the lecture. But at the same time, she doesn't help students learn. She doesn't answer questions with excuses of not being able to understand them, and is not helpful on Piazza, like other profs which help students",
      "She's least supportive in community discussion forums - doesn't foster collaborative learning. The lectures do not cover concrete stuff, she just covers the basics - mostly obvious stuff. At times, many of us read the book and found out what she taught us was wrong. Oh and - going to her office hours is really a waste of time. Better go to the TA !",
      "She doesn't put efforts into teaching. Tends to evade questions. Not collaborative in assignments. Also, when you ask a question in the class, either she'll cross question you / ask other students or she'll just say she doesn't understand your question.  In office hours, she just behaves horribly and doesn't seem to be supportive or helpful.",

      "Very nice teacher and his lectures are fun and useful. Algorithms are hard by nature, but he is a very helpful professor and assigns grade generously. Be sure to attend every class, otherwise you might not catch up. The final score is very largely based on midterm and final exams, so please be aware and PREPARE EARLY.",
      "He did a pretty good job. Only complaint is that we didn't cover some pretty important topics in discrete math because he teaches everything very slowly.",
      "Bender is an incredibly knowledgeable professor with an insane amount to offer each and every student. He will spend hours upon hours going over difficult material with you until you understand it, and make every single second in lecture worth your time and energy.  GO TO LECTURE!!! The homeworks are usually topics ripped directly from his mouth.",
      "Definitely get to know him. He spends a LOT of time after class talking to those who stay and ask questions. He will try and clear up any issues and talk about miscellany as well if there are no questions on the class.",
      "The guy is brilliant. He makes you smarter if you let him. Algorithms is hard, and if you don't like the subject, don't take the class. I feel like students who don't get it won't like the class no matter what. Exams do resemble the class content if you understand it because the questions connect concepts revealed in class, doesn't just repeat them",
      "Don't take first semester. Class is fun and cool and not helpful. May be glutted with Masters' students. No actual help. No Textbook. If you're not already accomplished, he doesn't want to talk to you. First test in NOVEMBER.  No feedback.",
      "I wasn't too happy with the way he was going about stuff in the beginning. But when I realised  how hard it is to teach Algorithms, I realized that he does a decent job. Do the assignments YOURSELF to learn as much as possible. Brush up your undergrad basics before his class. Says questions will repeat in the exams, guess what? Not anymore.",
      "Fun, charming, useless. Doesn't teach to any book. expects you to have detailed knowledge of algorithms. Doesn't teach how to solve recurrences. turns office hours into extra lectures so you can't get any extra help. No feedback available, focuses on food, and wants you to tell him why things are beautiful. Don't take him your first semester.",
      "CSE548 was awesome. Prof. Bender is great, and explains stuff so that those who don't know, understand, and those who already know it, have something new to learn. He is very helpful & actively encourages you to come to his office hours which is a great opportunity to learn the material better. I'm taking the advanced class next semester under him.",
      "Awesome guy! If you're at SUNY Stony Brook, you MUST take a class under him!",
      "Overrated! Very nice and all - he gave us free food - but, he teaches very little material compared to Rob Johnson's version of the class. He tends to get lost and start rambling about the places where he has eaten and other errata. Overall, very nice guy and knowledgeable. Just not the best quality.",
      "Very helpful, fair and a brilliant teacher.",
      "He's a very considerate professor! He changed our midterm date once because most of us weren't ready. Though the course material can be challenging, he can make it understandable and clear. The class is always in a ease pace. Love him and will take it again for fun!!",
      "While theory may not be my favorite part of computer science, he made the class very enjoyable. Office hours were extremely helpful and the tests (while tricky) were fair. The bagels were nice too.",
      "Everything said above, he's a very good teacher who not only doesn't let anyone leg behind but also keeps those ones who are ahead loaded with interesting work. Can explain complicated things simply and boring things interesting with insightful and interesting examples - all with a doze of fun. Hooray ! Get this teacher if you can :)",
      "This guy knows his stuff. He is well prepared and teaches the lessons efficiently, refusing to let anyone fall behind while keeping the more advanced students interested with alusions to his research and grad work. He promotes a great class environment like few at sbu. Although the workload can sometimes be much, it is worth it."

      "What a rollercoaster. Now that the grades are out, it seems like he failed 10% of the class. But also lots of people got As, so overall not too bad. Looking back on class, despite all the controversy and some of my buddies complaining, it's been quite fun. Would defintely take it again.",
      "The final was ok. This prof is indeed a bit unconventional and you need to keep up every week to pass. Absolutely cannot cram for it in last week. Smart buddy of mine tried to do that and got lowest grade in midterm. But very interesting class and now i know how bitcoin works. Take him if you don't need a good grade but want to do smth fun.",
      "Radu is one of the most unprofessional professors in the SBU CS department that I have experienced. His lectures are incredibly disorganized which is not surprising considering he didn't write a majority of them himself. He forces participation with random call outs which would be fine if he wasn't so snarky and passive aggressive.",
      "This professor is a bit showy, but i like him. This semester I feel I learned more in this class than in all other classes combined. Would take him again but he doesn't seem to teach many classes. Midterms just came back and I think he graded fairly.",
      "he is clearly different than most other professors, but at least for me he is probably one of the best in the department. full of energy. today i had maybe one of my best classes in stony brook (cloud security). but he doesn't seem like an easy guy to work with and we haven't gotten our midterm grades back yet so we'll see.",
      "This prof is very different that others in dept. Lots of material. you need to be in class and he asks allot of questions. But teaches enthused. A bit too much sometimes, but many interesting things. Would probably take again. But not at 8AM!!",
      "Do not take this professor. Up until the drop/add/swap classes deadline he goes at a reasonable pace. But after the deadline he ramps up the material to 100 and berates anyone who gives a wrong or unclear answer. He picks people at random for every question but no one is able to answer because the material was not taught yet. He expects you to know",
      "He acts like he's cool but he's not. Prof. Radu doesn't care about students at all. He'll throw random articles and videos at you and expect you to memorize them all. Feels more like a bad grad course than undergrad.",
      "prof radu is tough. he failed 10% of the class! he was too demanding. information science is not computer science. but lectures were really cool. would take him again.",
      "very enthusiastic and fun prof. class was great. but getting an a is crazy difficult, he gave only 10-11 A out of 60 students!! class is mostly research oriented, no textbook. online papers to read. TA was not available at all. Overall would take this prof again.",
      "Prof is pretty lazy in general. Misses/late for lectures; keeps on skipping slides which end up being on tests; has no sense of direction; tests you on reading esoteric papers on HiStar. Material should be hands-on; he makes it sleep-on.",
      "Professor Radu is really fun, but expects too much. Ppl cannot read all the assignments and understand them easily. More phd class than senior level. still learned allot and would take it again. hope he curves the grades for seniors differently than grads.",
      "This prof is unconventional. there's no textbook, but awesome lectures. really passionate. not much help for projects, TA is supposed to help but he grades weirdly. even so, would take this class again. lectures are great. prof ALWAYS wears jeans and t-shirt.",
      "He's all showy and all talk. When it comes to helping his students, he's lazy and NOT helpful at all. His courses are anything BUT useful. I wouldn't recommend him at all.",
      "Great lecturer & extremely knowledgeable with real world experience to back him up. Projects are monsters, don't expect him to hold your hand. Take the time to research and do the assignments. No matter what he says, he WILL grade the homeworks. Tests not a joke, study hard. you will bomb them, but so will everyone else. Be the best of the worst.",
      "He is a great lecturer and the material is very interesting, but if you want a good grade this is the wrong class to take. His assignments are ridiculously hard, the average on the midterm was about a 30, probably lower on the final.  I Think he gave \"C's\" to the vast majority of the class. The class is aimed at grad students rather then undergrad.",
      "Radu is probably the best professor as far as lecturing that I have yet to have.Course material is very interesting (minus 5 weeks of crypto), and he answers ?s precisely and on the fly.Assignments are challenging, and nothing you study can prepare you for the exams.Averages out of 100 were less than 35. However, I would take another class with him",
      "he travels too much, but when he is actually teaching hes great! no textbook, online mostly and from experience. had fun. grades harshly i heard.",
      "This professor is probably the best in computer science. Doesn't use textbook and gives quizzes, but great class. Will take other courses with him.",
      "Attendance is a must to pass. Very interesting and teaches from experience. I will take this professor again."

      "A real gem. He's not just an amazing professor, he's a great counsellor too. His courses, lectures, and feedbacks help you a long way in your career. I graduated a few years ago, but I'm still in contact with him via emails. He's the professor everyone needs in their lives. Truly an inspiration!",
      "The best course that I have taken at Stony Brook University. This course paved the way for me to work in File systems and Storage Lab. Definitely one of the most respected and knowledgable professors out there. DON'T MISS this course even if you don't have an interest in systems. This course is a gem! Very insightful!",
      "Prof. Erez Zadok is a great Professor, his OS courses are in detail and easy to understand. Homeworks have lots of coding, but they're do-able, and when you did it, you'll feel great. Lots of useful resourses and Q/As on Piazza. Homeworks are more important than exams - if you finish the homework all on your own, you won't fail exams. Thanks Erez!",
      "Prof. Zadok is by far the best professor I have ever had. He focuses on the right things and his way of teaching makes you truly enjoy and learn a lot at the same time. His course is very well structured and he has perfectly reasonable expectations from all students. The operating systems course CSE 506 under him is totally worth it.",
      "He has a well designed course, is one of the best Profs at SBU!",
      "If you want to learn about file systems, he's the guy. Very good course, but focus is mostly on file systems. You will learn a lot from his lectures and assignments. I haven't seen anybody explaining the Linux kernel code and the structures used in it better than he does. Tests are not that difficult and, in the end he gives really good grades.",
      "One of the best at SBU. Must take.",
      "Erez is one the best professors one can find in Stony Brook. His subject expertise is unmatched. He is able to simplify all the complicated concepts in class lectures very well and keeps students interested. Though his assignments are hard and demanding but completing them gives you thorough understanding of the concepts from coding point of view.",
      "He is one of the best Professors here at Stony Brook. We got hands on kernel programming experience, and though we stuck to mostly file systems, it cleared so many concepts. He is very helpful and always available via email or in his office hours. I highly suggest attend classes, he is a great teacher and really knows his stuff.",
      "Passion meets Perfection!! Very interesting classes. I love the classes when he talks about the history of foundations of UNIX/Linux. Looking forward to work with him.",
      "GREAT PROFESSOR. will always be willing to go out of his way to help you. Attend class! you will learn a lot even though you can get by with out since its a project based class. Explains things very well. Class was very interesting. Learned so much about unx systems. would deff recommend taking a class with him. gives extra credit on tests.",
      "Brilliant professor. Knows how to teach very well. Classes are extremely interesting. One warning though: Keep your course load light when you take Operating Systems with him. You will spend most of your time working on his assignments. Totally worth it in the end BTW. Must take his course if studying Computer Science at Stony Brook",
      "Great teacher I learned so much.Always willing to help outside of course",
      "An awesomest professor I ever came across. Extremely brilliant, helpful and very thorough with his explanations. His assignments are monsters but I must say end of the semester you will be deeply satisfied. If you are interested in operating system, then he is the prof!!",
      "Best Professor in Stony Brook University. Worth the Pain for his assignments. Extremely Helpful and Awesome lectures. Everyone should take his 506 Grad Course if you're a grad.",
      "He's a very good teacher. But teaches only filesystems.But a must take course.",
      "This class was very interesting.  Professor Zadok is extremely knowledgeable and is always available.  He chose excellent TA's, projects were challenging (but an overall practical learning experience), and tests were fair.  He grades very fairly.  I would definitely recommend taking a class with him.",
      "great prof!!! You should take his class!",
      "One the greatest people I can across!  Loves to teach what he knows",
      "Awesome professor, also a dunkin donut coffee advertisement..:) He knows his stuff and is one of the few ones who can actually pass on that knowledge successfuly to us, if you want to that is. He will make you work your ass off for the homeworks, but then that is the main thing in the class. Oh and he is a good grader too.",
      "Nice prof, very smart, knows what he's teaching, the class is very interesting too. Sometimes the prof is a bit boring.. but maybe that's just for me. But basically, I wouldn't hesitate taking another class with him.",
      "Took his course while back. Very supportive, explains clearly. Exellent Prof. Grade wise: you will get what you deserve."

Genuinely worst professor.",
      "Project is inappropriate for undergrad students. The final project often involves mathematics that most math majors would have to take a semester-long course for. Homeworks are only barely okay. He has a tendency to dodge questions as much as he possibly can.  DON'T. TAKE. HIS. COURSE. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.",
      "350 characters really is not enough. His lectures have zero to do with the homeworks which are comparable to 320 assignments. The tests are \"open laptop\", so he throws random crap on there. His project grading is extremely harsh. This class is plain unfair. If you are interested in graphics or not, AVOID.",
      "Don't take his course, seriously,  his attitude towards student is terrible,  even if you are interested in this course, study by yourself, or find it on Coursera,  he never designs the courses carefully, whatever CSE328 or 528,  the course materials of Computer Graphics are much more resourceful on the website.",
      "350 characters isn't enough to explain.  No matter how passionate you are about computer graphics, don't take this class.  You'll be better off learning on your own.",

      "Graphics is really a big topic in computer science, so it is impossible to clearly teach it in one semester. This course is designed for those who have clearly known something about graphics, and intend to do research in this field. For zero background student, this is disaster!!",
      "Class consists of 2 midterms and 1 final along with 2 homeworks.  Watch out for homework 1. I did 2 all nighters in a row to finish it but he gives you 1 month time head start. I should have definitely started it on day 1.  Homework 2 was much easier. He gives you the necessary code to perform the required graphic representations.",
      "You will regret it. Don't be stupid. No matter how much you like this topic you are going to have a poor experience. It's your funeral if you disregard what the others said.",
      "Worse excuse of a Professor to teach an otherwise interesting Computer Graphics Course. Period.",
      "Everything he talks sounds interesting, but it makes sense only on his head. I love computer graphic but I believe that i learn more by reading a book rather than going to his class.",
      "Generally I think he is responsible professor, but many students are complaining about the quality and the way he treats others, it is not very helpful to take his class because the CG is a class which requires practice, and his class requires you to take a big project which makes rookies feeling very hard",
      "He is an arrogant selfish guy. Knows little computer graphics and knows more how to trick students. You have to print submissions and go and submit it to his office. His teaching is absolutely terrible. He calls students to his office and doesn't show up. He lies routinely. His grades are very bad too. Definitely don't take his class.",
      "Terrible professor for what would otherwise be an interesting class.  Throws assignments at you and tells you to figure it out yourself.  Ask for help and be shamed and humiliated by him.  Avoid at all costs.  Seriously.",
      "Excellent graduate level course. Trains your research ability by requiring a survey of publications and an implementation of recent paper.",
      "Covers a great deal of course. Focuses on project, but you need to write a good survey report too for an A. His goal is that you'll know breadth of C. Graphics (lectures) and also have in depth knowledge in some area (your project and survey). He has awesome memory and he is a good guy.",
      "His lectures are difficult to follow. Not because the material is tough, but because he is terrible at teaching. He doesn't prepare people for the homework adequately. Does not provide much of a starting point for what are somewhat lengthy programming assignments. Textbook is ok, but a lot of its content is dated, even in most recent edition.",
      "The absolute worst professor I have had the misfortune of taking a class with. Not only does he speak abstractly about everything, but, he encourages you to use DEPRECATED functionality, instead of teaching current stuff (VBOs, Programmable Pipeline, etc.). Seriously, DON'T take 328 with him, it ruined my semester.",
      "Horrible. Never take this class during the semesters he teaches it. Assigns you a grad-level project (40% of grade) where you have to choose legit, scientific papers and implement the algorithms mentioned in the papers. You are helpless; TAs know less than you do and he just decides to abstractly talk about the topic you chose if you ask for help.",

He made this course so hard and it's the only other course for those hoping to major in CS without programming experience, destroying their dreams of majoring in CS.",
      "Although there are complaints here about CSE 101 and 114, don't be afraid of Tashbook if you're taking CSE 312. He understands the material very well and is actually interested in teaching it. Unlike CSE101/114, Tashbook's expectations of us are reasonable. My only complaint is that he used pop quizzes to take attendance.",

      "He didn't take my year lightly. Beware!",
      "As a T.A. for this course, all the comments here are correct. But I think it's the department's fault for assigning material that's too hard, not his fault. Tashbook seems to care, but is just overloaded with work. As for the curve: if your avg. test score is 65%, your final grade will be 'A'. Only way to avoid this course: take the AP CS test.",
      "Sometime he will cancel the class, but the slide for one to learn is clear. Be prepared to put your effort into this course, it is hard to get a good grade without working hard. I fail midterms and final but I receive an satisfied grade at the end because the curve is huge.",
      "The CS final has ended for almost three weeks, and he posted that I failed two labs. However, there's no time for me to revise my lab works. Even though the class is not that hard, but he always postpone to post the grades, and make you have no time to revise it.",
      "He cancelled class all the time, gave tests the ta's all said were too hard, gave 1 homework in october and the other 8 in the last week up to finals all at once, homeworks that the ta's said were more advanced then what they were doing in their current classes, the first exam was horrible and he apologized, and then made the second one even harder",
      "He gives very detailed lectures but cancels classes and office hours very often. Always sending messages and assigning assignments past midnight. Not only does he assign homework late, but always grades labs and homework late. Though he is a pretty nice and caring person, just an irresponsible professor.",
      "I took his CSE 114 in 2017. He is a really tough grader and give a lot of assignments. However, his lecture is really detailed. He made every difficult concepts easier to understand. You will spend a bunch of time on his course and his class is totally not a good choice if you want take it for credits.",

I heard he was going through some health issues. Seeing all these bad comments below makes me sad. I think the CS department needs to fix their themselve as they are a total mess right now.",
      "I don't know how's his 101 class, but he's definitely not a responsible professor for CSE 114. His lectures were not amazing, but not super bad. I would give him a 2.5 out of 5 for his lectures. However, he's NOT a responsible professor!!!!!!!! He NEVER get anything done in time (e.g. post hw, update final grade)!! He NEVER response to any email!!",
      "He is a nice guy, but he will never respond your email questions or piazza questions. He may be a good professor, but he is absolute not a good instructor or a good teacher.",
      "There's no curve, he makes the class very tough, everything seems to be academic dishonesty to him, cancels a lot of classes, and he takes forever to grade assignments.",
      "Lecture slides are essentially word for word the textbook, quizzes are given everyday for attendance and they do count, homework were delayed and instructions are not clear. Do not, I repeat do not think about working with a friend on the HW or final project you will get reported for academic dishonesty. Over 50+ people were reported this semester.",
      "Tougher class than past semesters, with midterm avg 55 and final avg of a 65, and no curve. That being said, Tashbook is a wonderful, clear lecturer, and quite literally the nicest professor you will ever find. The class is doable with a lot of work. Just know, he's pretty unreliable by email, and assignments don't always follow the date posted.",
      "Tashbook was very sick this entire semester. As a result of his sickness, he canceled and postponed a lot of classes and homework. The first midterm was pretty hard for a 101 class. He toned it down midterm 2 and final though. He hosted a review session a day before the finals. I recommend him because he is very caring towards his students.",

Cancelled >8 classes (majority within hour of class), cancelled/postponed at least 5 assignments, postponed midterm day of exam 5 times, didn't receive a single grade til last month of course. It has been 8 days since the end of class & Im still waiting on the final hw to be ASSIGNED. its finals week. DO NOT TAKE!!",

      "Gives what is essentially a 5 question quiz every class. Most obnoxious CS professor in this school. Try your very best not to take him.",
      "Dr. Scarlatos is bent on making sure you attend every lecture. If you don't, you'll lose a lot of points. The course has no final exam, but you have to do 2 group projects that are big and aren't fun. He has a lot of enthusiasm, but can be self-centered. Luckily I dropped this course in the first week. Avoid Scarlatos if you can.",
      "The class was an interesting topic but a terrible egocentric professor. I don't think he does it in purpose but comes off as very rude. for example during a group project we asked if anyone has questions and he quickly snapped back that we didn't have time for questions but for another group who had a long 4 minute video he made multiple comments",
      "Horrible professor who speaks down on his students when they ask questions. His lectures are boring and unnecessary, this class is a joke. Homework takes forever to be graded and attendance is taken whenever he feels like it. Hes full of himself and it shows through his conversations with students and TAs. Avoid him if possible",
      "half the class is youtube videos. more than 90% of students are playing games on their devices. Never used textbook at all. quizes based on memorizing over 100 slides but contain only 20 questions. absolutely harsh grader. Did all the assignments, even got hundreds on quizes and projects but still got a low grade bc of 2 absence. terrible professor",
      "He does brush off questions sometimes but if you put in the effort to learn Blender this class is an easy A.  The majority of the semester is doing simple creative assignments which give you a break from other work.  There are NO TESTS AND NO FINAL!  Just because you didn't put in effort doesn't mean he's a bad professor...",
      "Such a ridiculously easy class.. guy isn't that bad he gave three homeworks and three projects but there pretty straightforward",
      "He has a very vague sense of direction and style of teaching. There are no clear due dates, and he randomly posts arbitrary assignments. No announcements and a short time to complete the work; needless to say, many didn't see the assignment until after the due date. He is very short and sarcastic in general, brushes off questions.  Not the best.",
      "One of the worst classes I have taken so far. His projects that he assigns are very vague. The outline that is online usually does not match what he says in class causing confusion. When asked for clarification he does very little to help and brushes you off.",
      "Not a bad professor at all. He dos expect alot from his students but overall if you show up for class, pay attention to his tutorials, and use youtube a little u can easily get an A. He does tend to brush off questions but if you show up to his TA's office hours you can easily figure Blender out. Almost all of your grade relies on work done at home",
      "Although I gave him super low score, but he isn't abusive to student, just he's not clear, can't help, and expect you to do stuff. U may sometimes ask him question relate to program he assign, and he will tell you to figure out yourself. In the end of semester you will need to give him all your work.  The upside, photoshop is fun.",

His lectures are beyond unrewarding; he just reads articles in a monotone voice and barely discusses the ethics. This class is very easy, but I didn't learn much besides his political opinions. I would avoid taking a class with him.",
      "The topics were OK, but some software are useless. I really think we should have focused more on Photoshop and Flash instead of so many techniques. Classes go too fast to catch the points. Basically, you have to teach yourself. Every time you submitted homework you have to wait at least a week to get feedbacks and mostly based on his own opinion!",
      "He doesn't teach much, you have to watch tutorial videos on your own. When he does teach, he goes way to fast and you're lost within seconds. Assignments are not clear and you have to just hope you're doing what he wants. Has a  big ego and can be condescending, but seems to be a fair grader.  Class can be time consuming so be aware",
      "391 is the 3D class. Takes attendance. Be prepared to watch a LOT of tutorials at home because his tutorials in class are confusing and way too fast. Don't ask to repeat himself or questions in general.. He'll just get annoyed at you. Insane amount of work (esp. at the end of the semester) with lots of frustrating problems to work out by yourself",
      "The work isn't so bad, more annoying just to get it done. I've always done every assignment the night before and have gotten full credit on each one. Takes attendance but the lectures are useless. He's really unclear when he talks, so just follow the rubric that's posted on BB - pray you're doing what he wants!",
      "Lectures are useful and educational. Lots of real life cases to discuss. BUT, let's discuss the professor's style. -Exams doesn't necessarily match his lectures. -If you want to talk to him, never expect an email reply - go to his office hours only. -Also. don't try to speak against him, if you are looking forward to a good grade.",
      "Objective C is a very confusing language so be prepared to put in the work to use outside tutorials to learn this stuff. He has a TA teach the students how to make basic applications but usually the TA goes too fast so a lot of self learning is needed. Having a mac definitely helps because xcode is only on macs. He's a fair grader & great guy",
      "He's probably only good with this class, but CSE 334 wasn't so bad. You'd have to do a lot of self-work outside of class though. The entire semester is you working on a final project using mostly blender. It should be an easy A as long as you completed the overall project well. You'll feel proud in the end. TRUST ME!!",
      "This guy is terrible. He's spotty in terms of taking attendance and his assignments are beyond unrewarding. Dry lectures, reads straight from slides or articles in a monotone voice and expects you to follow along. Barely any of the ethics discussed related to IT.

      "Almost every class consisted of having vague discussions on personal ethics, then he surprise attacks you with tests about extremely specific details of laws that he mentions for 5 seconds in class before having a 30 minute discussion about a vacation he took or some other useless information.

Overall a great professor!",
      "Radfar seems to be a nice person, but isn't inspirational at all. He mostly reads off the slides supplied by the textbook and explains some additional things. You will have to write a few Python scripts in this course (hard if you've never used Python before). Attendance is checked with little quizzes. The tests are confusing and have bad spelling.",

So you could honestly not go to class and just teach yourself from the textbook, but he does give quizzes and occasionally a pop quiz that counts towards your grade. Wish he was more engaging, but he's not the absolute worst for 215.",

The class has strictly followed the textbook as I believe all his knowledge about networks was from reading not mastering the textbook. My assumption can be evidenced by his tests which focus on trifling topics which didn't reflect your ability",
      "I took CSE215 with professor Radfar in Fall 2017. He is a very knowledgeable professor and makes the teaching materials easy to understand. Perhaps one of the best professors in the department of Computer Science. He is very attentive and friendly. The exams, assignment, and quizzes are very fair and not difficult to get an A in his class. He",

In the presentations he gave everyone full marks without evaluating the clarity and coherency of the speakers, this led to a very skewed curve and most of the students ended up getting A- even if they had a 90+ aggregate. He added a 10% bonus on the project but that was of no use"

He is new to CSE 373 which means lots of things don't complete. No typed slides. Exams are not strongly related to course contents. The capacity is 200;98 enrolled;20 attend. Think carefully.",

Exams were little harder to solve but if you attend the lectures and carefully make notes, connecting the dots would not be that hard.",

He is receptive to questions in class and in office hours. Most of the fire he spits out comes from when he talks about the topic. Which is why its important to listen closely and sit in the front row."

Also, he digressed a lot sometimes to give the bigger picture. So that was good. But it's a lot of work to cram up into one course.",
      "Professor CR is one of the best guys around. His interest levels in the subject and towards computer science are very appreciable. He's however lazy and rarely grades on time OR even reply to emails even during deadlines.He's a fair grader though.",
      "Not teacher material.  Rude, no social skills, horrible temperament.  You better wish the TA or text book is good, b/c you aren't going to learn from him",
      "very nice teacher",
      "I can honestly say that I learned absolutely nothing in this mans classroom. Everything I know about the material, I had to teach myself. And I mean that as literally as possible. Going to his class could not possibly be more of a waste of time.",

      "He knows how to make students interested, and the lecture wasn't too hard.  however, the homework was horrible and it took me 20 hrs to give it up.",
      "I think his accent is very strong for someone who has been in the US for over a decade... but that's something that can't be helped.  He tries his best to make the lectures interesting by making jokes whether they're corny or not.  The first few hws weren't too bad, but the later ones were crazy har",
      "As a lecturer, he is pretty good- he keeps students somewhat interested. He has a slight accent, but not horrible.  HOWEVER, some of his homeworks are crazy.  The 1st few weren't bad, but a C compiler in SML? Ha! And the final was 21 pages!  Basically he's a good professor, but gotta work for an A",
      "Guy is very smart and helpful when you come for help. He's nice and usually willing to postpone HWs when needed. Lectures are kinda useless since he makes you fall asleep. Grades fairly however, and if you read the book and do the hw, you should be fine.",
      "can't understand what he says. i taught myself when i was taking that course.",
      "This Indian dude is freaken smart, but he sucks at explaining and speaking English. Feel sorry for the guy!",

      "Interesting, interactive, and fun class. Clearly, the instructor put a lot of effort to make the course awesome.",
      "The professor is passionate in giving valuable lessons every class. He encourages students to read useful materials, let us have opportunities to think deeply in a subject matter, and put his time and efforts for us to write well.",
      "He is truly nice. It was not hard to find out he sincerely wants to help students in reasonable ways. Although the general opinion on this course--only in this semester-- was that the quizzes and assignments were difficult, at the same time, he gave sufficient EC opportunities while spending his time meeting and giving advice to students.",
      "Tough grader, can seem nit picking at times, but he is really fair prof. Like other said he gives lots of EC so you have plenty of chances to get a better grade. If you make an effort he is very willing to help you. CS at SUNY-Korea has LOTS of cheaters, this prof hates cheaters he catch 4 in our class - don't cheat with him.",
      "I started the class with not knowing how to program and ended class with making a game with 2 other team members. Professor met me at night and over weekends to help me with problems I had, no other professor did this for me. I learned a lot - he is pushes you to do your best and wants you to learn a lot on your own. Do ALL extra credit he offer!",
      "The biggest problem in my section of this class was the students that are lazy and didnt want to do the work or prepare of class - this made the whole class suffer because professor didn't want anyone to fail. As a prof I think he is fine, the material is not so exciting, so just do the work and get through it. Gives lots of EC :)",
      "Professor Adam really tries to get you to participate, he asks a lot of questions in class. If you review the material, do the readings and assignments you will do fine. I think most students do not put the effort in to trying to understand the material, they just want to be given a good grade. He is tough but very fair, gives lots of extra credit.",
      "Had a rough start at the beginning of the semester, but later on the class really caught upto itself. At the end of term, I walked out as a confident programmer. A lot of work, but it's worth it. Flexible when it comes to deadlines, but make sure you don't abuse it. A good person with tons of industry relevant experience. A+",
      "I didn't like his teaching style. He didn't teach what he knows. He just delivered what the textbook and the online pdf said. I am curious how he became a lecturer.",
      "I took cse101 in Fall 2016. I am not a CS major and it's a very difficult course for me, but I learnt alot. Second half of course has lots of work on a group project that we want to do. He gave the class a big pizza party on the final day of our project presentations. :) He expects and pushes you to work hard and earn a good grade. He can be funny.",
      "He tries very hard to get all students involved and answer questions in class - this sort of make class go slow - but I think it shows that he really want student to understand. He can be very funny but really serious too. Unlike many other profs when he give reading make sure you do it. His quizzes can be crazy (I worry about midterm) but fair.",

      "One of the best professors at SBU. If you're a CS student, you must blindly enroll in any course that he's taking. Though his lectures can sometime be a little difficult to understand for someone who's learning the topics for the first time, read up the readings he posts and follow his slides - he's always ready to help. He's simply the best!",

The lectures were always incredibly interesting and Bachmair has a talent for explaining complicated things really simply. The homework was so enjoyable that I always looked forward to doing it. His class made me fall in love with math and CS.",
      "lots of homework and exams but it isnt very difficult. He explains the material well. Just pay attention in class and do well on your tests. Tests determine your grade.",
      "A very challenging course where the tests do not even correspond with what we do in class. Sure they are the same topics, but it felt more like answering trivia questions than applying the actual concepts learned in class to actually SOLVE the problems. The exams are MC which is designed to trip you up completely.",
      "Frankly, Leo is really kind prof. However, he is a little rigid, especially in the grade policy. No CURVE! Be careful, I'm not joking, If you want a good grade, you should always focus on your every homework and midterm. If you don't like this course, it will be suffer for you. you should do more work than required. the practice exam is useless.",
      "Practice tests are NOTHING compared to the real one, and he holds no review sessions whatsoever. Short answer practice tests, multiple choice tests that barely make sense if you just go off the practice. There is no partial credit for any silly mistakes you make, so beware if you take Leo. I know a lot of those who passed but were still screwed.",
      "You can work on homework in groups, lecture is not hard to understand or follow. But don't count on his review tests. The real test is always A LOT more difficult than the review test or homework. You have to really understand the concepts and material to do well in the exams. Otherwise, it feels like you are being tested on things you didn't learn",
      "Learn a lot from professor Leo. His explanation is very clear and easy to understand. Loading is affordable. Try to do well on every homework and exam and you'll get at least an A-.",
      "Very straightforward class where as long as you do the homeworks (worth 25% of the course) and got to course, you will do fine. Final Exam was tough, but curved the course to benefit us due to it.   Overall, he's a decent Professor. Had no problem with this course.",
      "Overall, he's a really nice guy. If you ask a question after class, he'll do the best he can to explain and help you. His lectures can be somewhat confusing, so pay attention. Make you sure you understand his examples, read the textbook, and do the homework.",
      "He is very clear with his expectation. Follow the book very closely. Midterm and final exam are quite tough but doable. Maximize your score on homeworks then you will be fine. I learned a lot from him about how to prove something  as he does the proof step by step on the blackboard.",
      "His voice can be monotonous at times, but he's really not that bad! He definitely know his stuff, and he does a solid job of teaching the material. If it weren't for his accent, he'd be really clear, but you get used to it. Also, as long as you get around the median, or a little above it, you'll get a good grade.",
      "I don't understand the amount of hate this man gets. He is actually really nice. He's a good teacher who has fair exams. However, he tends to penalize heavily for small mistakes on exams. Nonetheless, I felt that he taught the material effectively and I would recommend him for someone who does want to learn Computer Science.",
      "Boring class, didn't learn much from professor. Mainly learned by myself. The tests aren't curved which makes this class tough. The average was 50s but still no curve. Prepare to study hard",
      "He is very unhelpful Professor. I took a class with him in 1997 and then he became Department Head and had to pass requirements by him.  What I had approved by Prof. Henderson, he undid it and I had to take 2 classes more to graduate.  His teaching style is very boring.",
      "I highly recommend taking this class with Bachmair -- the topics you cover are really essential for computer science and will make your life in other CSE courses (specifically 304 and 307) a lot more enjoyable.  You might get a better grade if you take it with another prof, but I wouldn't use this class as a GPA booster because it's too important.",
      "Had him for Foundations of CS Honors.  All he gives you to help you study for midterms/finals is the previous year's test.  There is an uncountable amount of ways to ask a question on one of the topics so just giving one example doesn't help at all.  Doesn't hold any reviews for midterm/final.",
      "This class was really easy.  Weekly homeworks were pretty simple, and the tests were fair.  Huge curve at the end of the semester which isn't even really necessary. Lectures can be boring but he always throws in a joke or two.  Seems like a nice man",
      "Bachmair is good professor with a dry sense of humor.  Initially it may seem he is very serious but he is funny.  He kept the subject interesting and showed enthusiasm for the class. He was always available to help in office hours or by appointment if I needed help.  His grading was fair.",
      "Hes not as bad as everyone says. You got to be on your game the whole term though if you want a good grade. You arent going to suddenly get an A on the final unless you know your stuff. Hes pretty clear with his lectures and instructions. His grading is straight forward; would take again.",
      "I was his TA before. He's a really nice professor, always reasonable.",
      "The class at most times is very boring and he makes the material really uninteresting. But he gives a lot of extra credit and fairly decent exams. just do the homework and study and it should be fine",
      "He likes to make the exams more harder, and no review session, practice exam, and please bring yourself a pillow in his class. His lecture notes had nothing to do with the exams. In brief, he doesn't know how to teach ! and you won't learn anything from him !",
      "This is a new course.His tests had nothing to do with class material, and there were no practice exams.  You don't need to sit through his class; notes are incomprehensible and have no bearing on any test question, lectures are pointless, monotone, and drag.  READ the text like crazzzzzy!... it's your only chance. Tests = 5 or less questions.",
      "Very confusing.. doesn't really answer the questions. but rather just says>>>\"umm the comment by this students is <students' questions goes here>\" and then asks other students in the class to answer the question.. in other words,umm lets see, NEVER ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS.",

      "No Comments",
      "There were roughly 20 of us in the class, but only 10 or so attended, and yet by the end of the semester he knew none of us by name.  He does little to make the class interesting or clear.  Additonally, his assignments are only loosely connected to the lectures.  Avoid him if possible.  Oh yeah, and his accent doesn't help.",
      "The class is dead boring and he definitely makes it so, but he's not a bad prof. As long as you study, not necessarily too much, you'll do fine.",
      "A nice guy, but defintely the worst prof I've had here at SBU. If you can somehow survive his voice that makes you want to go to sleep, he isn't even that helpful, He doesn't give students a straight answer to their questions, and the list goes on but I have no room. DONT TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM AS THE PROF!"

But you really have to be prepared for class: dont skip class, do your readings, pay attention in class, take notes, participate in class. The class was heavy and time consuming but worth it in the end: made it easier for me to pass interviews with systems companies.",
      "Makes lectures interesting and easy to grasp. But be ready to do a lot of lab assignments. His teaching pace is not at par with the lab assignments. Sometimes, you will have to learn by yourself to do lab assignments. He does not answer your queries much, not help students much, will definitely make fun of you in class.",
      "Worst Professor ever !!!",
      "Pros Good course, will learn a lot about Computer Architecture  Cons Its shameful how he is partial to some students Actually makes fun of certain questions asked in class and then expects you to participate in class discussions Gives you a whole processor to implement but has no intermediate deadlines or checkpoints Can even insult students",
      "Terrible professor !!",
      "Best professor ever",
      "He is the worst professor I have ever had. He is unclear. He is arrogant. He humiliates the students if they make mistake. He only cares about some students in the class and ignores others. The course project is irrelevant to the lectures. I can guarantee that he himself can't handle it. I regret taking this course and highly discourage others.",
      "From knowing nothing about hardware programing to build a SPARC processor almost from scratch. You bet you know most, if not all, details about how processors work at the end of the course.  And the lectures are closely related to project if you pay attention and give enough thinkings to it.",
      "The course is really tough, but also the best class by far that I've taken so far. Well worth the effort, but effort required IS substantial, brace yourself. Excellent teacher and course material. Very helpful. If you make it through, you'll feel you've earned knighthood and learned tons!! Strongly Advised: start project from day 1",
      "Classes are a must to attend; lectures are well organized and content is interesting. Goes out of the way to help you if you reach out to him, given that you do your share of workreading. Sets a high, but not impossible standard, to pass the course. Afterwards, you really feel you have learned a lot. If you are a real student, take his courses !!",
      "Worst teacher ever. Class is not at all related to the project. No point attending the class. If you want to pass this course for your qual you need to be an expert from before to pass it. If you have never had huge experience in Architecture don't even think about taking this course.",
      "Don't trust what he says in the first lecture. He says you do not need a lot of background. But that is not the case. You do need A LOT OF BACKGROUND to pass.  The medianaverage grade is B-, so If you are taking it as a qual and you didn't have previous years in architecture coding, then be warned, only those few groups with exp. will pass."

Of course, this is truly a self-learning course.",

There are too many questions in his tests, and the time is very short and this makes his exams hard. Do not recommend at all.",

The workload is not much, in the end he is lenient on grading, one can easily get an A- with nominal effort. He's also cooperative of you miss exams with a genuine reason.",

The only criticism would be the class has no set schedule or structure but that didn't really bother me much.",

It'd be nice if the class had more structure but then, well, it wouldn't be a Rob Johnson class.",

The topics and material are good and all, but the course itself was very poorly structured, most lectures were spent tediously dissecting specific examples on the chalkboard, and there was never anything to tie it all together. Lectures were dry, andthe only resource he provided was MIT courseware, whichdidnt help",

Take 373 with Skiena.",

      "Nice guy, but extremely disorganized. Not sure if he really cares about his job.",
      "Very nice and helpful, lectures are very interesting. Tends to put a bit too much emphasis on theory in lectures, and grade depended only on a final project and final exam - press him to assign homework or you'll have no idea how you're doing along the way.",
      "He is awesome. Best professor in the department. He is helpful and explains things very clearly. Go to his office hours. Very cool and funny too. He has all the qualities that a student wants in professor. Take him.",
      "One just needs to pay attention in his lectures. One of the best professors in SBU. The course can tend to be a little theoretical, but he does explain practical uses of the techniques.",
      "This class was insanely confusing/difficult for someone without a pure math background. He goes through a lot of material very quickly although he is extremely helpful during office hours. He would make time for everyone who comes. Grading is on the generous side considering how badly the majority of the class did.",
      "Dr.Johnson is da man. The class was hard, and there didn't seem to be a firm direction of what was going to be taught and in what order. However he is reasonable with the grading, so that your GPA doesn't get screwed for taking an honors course. The guy knows his stuff, and the course was full of interesting problems and discussion.",
      "Don't listen to the last guy... he obviously never went to class.  Professor Johnson is clear, interesting, and is very easy going.  Do the work (best u can), study for the tests, dazzle him with the project and get the A you deserve.  Test averages are fairly low, but he grades nicely and will even answer questions up until the exam is handed out!",
      "Be warned, maybe he's a better teacher in other classes but taking 409 with him is terrible. He does not follow a textbook and doesn't post any notes writing everything on the board. The articles are difficult to read and he required you to write a \"review\"! not a \"summary\", don't take this class just because you liked 408, take it if you liked 306",
      "he is extremely helpful ...he can put the likely hardest things into the easiest things.",
      "The class is very difficult, but he explains the subjects as well as possible. The workload isn't insanely heavy, but the homework assignments given are pretty difficult. This is balanced out nicely by his EXTREME helpfulness, often creating 3 or 4 hour blocks just to help us with the homework, on his time, outside of office hours. Nice, dedicated.",
      "By far one of the best prof in the dept.  take good notes in class, he is very helpful and willing.  Exams are challenging.  Material interesting."

      "One of the best lecturers, I have ever had. Very helpful and responsive. Cares about the students. Helps as much as possible. Assignments are easy if you attend the class. Exam questions are similar to the assignment questions. He gives some hints about the exam questions during the semester. TAs grade poorly. Overall, Highly recommended.",
      "The class is for C programming, you will not touch upon C++ or C#. He writes code theory on the board then expects students to be able to write actual code in a program.  He gives out weekly homework which is usually very hard. The homework is strictly graded so even a small flaw will cost  can cost you 30% on each assignment. ESG 111 gets a 0/10"

If one attends class, pays attention to the lectures and does the homework (on your own). one could probably get an A with ease.

Labs were the most difficult because lectures had nothing to do with what we learned in class. Another issue is he doesn't post the lecture slides till 1 or 2 days before the exam. He isn't all that bad though.",

His labs has nothing to do with the slides at all and you need to learn everything yourself. Worst teacher in stony brook hands down.",

When the due date comes up for these labs, the professor is either sick or there is a guest lecturer. Vague about midterm and final materials. Does not provide any review material at all. Average on midterm was 30/100. Do not take at all cost!",
      "This professor always disappears the class before the labs are due.  The lab instructions are also very vague.  The TA is more helpful.  Instead of putting up the lecture slides before spring break so students can study, he posted them up only two days before the midterm.",
      "Lab assignments are confusing and unclear. Says he will post lectures slides on website, but never does. Lectures are also unclear.",

Lectures were interactive and they can be fun if you have some knowledge about the topic. He is quite helpful and guides well.

      "She is friendly and has a good sense of humor. Knows the subject and teaches very well. Her accent is a bit difficult to follow. She expects her students to work hard, though sometimes she gives extensions for assignments and bonuses for early submissions. No one knows how she gives grades, and you can end up with a low grade even if you work hard.",
      "YANNI IS THE BEST!",
      "Yanni Lui is one of my favorite professors in the CS department. She's a great lecturer and genuinely cares about the success of her students. The class is mainly assignments (python, perl, and some sys admin) and quizzes. One final exam and theres lots of extra credit. I learned a lot about scripting and highly recommend it.",
      "My favorite professor in CSE department. Her lectures are crystal clear but can be a bit boring sometimes, has a clear grading criteria. Overall, you will have to work to get a good grade but at the end of the day, it's worth it because you will learn something from her classes",
      "Puts in a lot of effort to help students do well. I thought the class was great for those who want to become familiar with some scripting languages, specifically python and Perl. Homework was extremely useful, challenging and fair. She gave lots of extra credit. She tells you everything you should expect. Exams were also fair. Worked hard for my A.",
      "Her lecture could use a lot of work and be a bit more interactive rather than just explaining slides, but it works. By no means an easy class; worked really hard to get my grade, but the topic was fun, interesting, and you learn a lot. Helpful class for both CSE and ISE majors. If she's the professor, do it.",
      "Fair and cares about your education. Might not be the clearest in lecture but will make it up if you truly want to learn the material and end up going to her office hours. Personally, CSE 110 was too easy so I didn't. But, she was understanding of the people who knew the material already and weren't inclined to sit through every lecture.",
      "Very good professor! I really enjoyed this class. She gives amazing practice material for the tests. And best of all, her office hours are helpful. She explains things clearly. She warns people not to cheat often, and it is very important point. Be prepared to study hard for this class. The knowledge is very useful. Getting an A was pretty tough.",
      "Make sure to do everything she asks. Look at the specifications for each assignment. One big writing assignment and the rest should be fairly simple and a presentation. Takes attendance randomly. Tells you everything she requires and expects, so no surprises. She's very considerate.",
      "This course should be an automatic A for anyone taking it with professor Liu. She takes more time than any professor I've had to make it EXTREMELY clear exactly what topics will be covered, what she expects on papers, and what to do on presentations. She actually cares about students and makes a concerted effort to help in any and every way. Liu >",
      "She's been really helpful and easy to reach during the semester. 4 essay assignments + few exercises + 2 presentation (1 mock interview). She always follows a rubric when grading assignments and she allows appeals. I got an A and would recommend her.",

Go to her office hours if you need help, she's helpful there. She really does show that she wants us to do good and tells us what we need to know for the class.",
      "She gives assignments that have nothing to do with anything she has taught us. There is no textbook for this course. I have her for system admin and networking, and she doesn't seem to understand either topic. Extremely self absorbed and doesn't help students at all, avoid if at all possible unless you want to teach yourself from google completely.",
      "THis is the worst subject that I  took in my entire life. Worth less. Dont ever question her if she is wrong. All she'll brag about is about her relations with some eminent profs. She will target you during the gradings if you ever come under her radar. Never ever I got a B in any subjects, and I ws given a C because of some nasty trivial reasons.",
      "i took her first for 312, i didnt think she was a bad teacher, she didnt penalize anyone after hurricane sandy, and i never had any problems with her. easy hw and midterm was straight foward just study the slides. I got an A in the class and again im not the def. of a star student. just be a nice person and show respect and shell do the same for u",
      "Prof. Liu is demanding, but she is a really nice and understanding professor. If you show your dedication, she will give you crystal clear advises to help you. She keeps everything in class updated and help the whole class to learn and develop. One of the most honorable professor in CS department.",
      "Really difficult teacher. Very picky grader, and she doesn't help by giving these picky quizzes.",
      "As a professor, she is very helpful and tries very hard. Always available at office hours. ISE 311 on the other hand, is hell if you have never used Linux before. The toughness of the course combined with a foreign professor (even though she tries her best and does a decent job) make this class awful if you're new to the material. Good luck!!!!!!",
      "Very hard to follow, she does have a accent but that's not the problem, she just projects textbook pages and keeps talking without a any good structure. In a Grad Networking course she assigns random teammates, enforced. No point in coming to class, so attendance dropped and she started taking attendance.",
      "She does not know the material she is teaching. She has strong personal preferences when she is giving grades. Her grades are not fair.",

No need to explain more, and you will figure out how horrible he is, once you attend at first class.",
      "He spends the first half of class time talking about his personal life, and the second half reading directly from slides.  His grading is arbitrary and ridiculous; don't try to use any big words in your papers because they confuse him.  Actually everything confuses him.  You will not learn how to improve your writing from this man.",
      "Spends at least half the lecture time talking about his personal life. Reads word-for-word the lecture slides without knowing the material. Is extremely picky in grading and marks things wrong unnecessarily on papers.",
      "One of the nicest professors in the dept. extremely knowledgeable and concerned about the students. approachable, understanding and down to earth. but you have to work hard to get an A in his class. fair grader.",
      "Doesn't give proficiencies to anyone. Gives assignment direct from the book. Penalizes if answer matches the solutions manual. Teaches by sitting and delivering. Lame efforts to make the class interesting by giving stupid anecdotes (as if the class is not enough to make u sleep). Many absentees in the class. People come only on exam days.",
      "the friendly teacher makes you like science more, and eager to learn.",
      "His HWs are long, & at times tedious, but they help you understand the material. He is very helpful unlike most professors in Stony Brook. He's funny & very relaxed and knows his stuff. He might wander off talking about his experiences during lecture & while that might be distracting, it really gives you insight into the industry and its history.",
      "Exremely knowledgable about the subject. Concerned and helpful towards students understanding. Inculcates enthusiasm and interest in the subject.",
      "Amazing professor. Very good teacher, extremely talented but down to earth.",
      "great professor! really nice to hear from someone so experienced in the field!",
      "He's helpful and takes interest in his students. Very approachable.Will sit with you and go through everything till you understand even if it means sitting for a couple of hours after class and getting home late.Generally tends to be late by a couple of minutes. His knowledge for the subject is immense and his zeal,unrivaled.One of the better Profs",
      "He is kind of a rough grader but the class isn't hard. Do the writing assignments, do the revisions he asks. He's a little annoying with how he wants things done (1.5 spacing, not over or under the word number requirements), but that's not too bad. He's a good guy to take CSE 300 with.",
      "Class can be boring at times, especially when he is sitting with his back to the students. I liked his class though and I would deffinitelly consider taking another class with him!",
      "Do nothing to help students passing his stupid requirement.  Insultin' students like \"you're not likely to pass; you might have to revise your essay\" even before reading it.  Being picky won't help students AT ALL!",
      "Not on time. Did not help students with writing problems. Insults student of their hard work. Assumes students would redo the 8+ page 1.5 spaced paper nonstop within 2-3 days without need to take other classes. Tortures students taking writing req. in Fall 04 for the CS Department's \"accreditation\".",

      "The homeworks required reading many research papers. It was challenging at first but gets easier later. And the paper discussions were the best, because the professor explains the paper very well, and is good at addressing doubt of students. The lectures were also good, and I attended all of them.",
      "very nice and forgiving if you are lost and seek for help. the best part is the class project. it was hard but good experience.",
      "If you aren't sure you want to take NLP, avoid her at all costs. She is consistently unclear with her directions and her exam was filled with trivial, uninteresting questions that you could answer by memorizing the slides. It was also far too long. Class is not too hard, I got an AS, but she is difficult to work with, critical, and very unhelpful."

Knows what she is talking about, really knows everything there is to know about Computer Science Multi-Media, may not be an expert in all the aspects but know her fundamentals, and how to apply them.",
      "Teaches the course differently than what is on the description. Class atmosphere can be described as \"laid back\". Fair amount of (not difficult) coding. Final project is up to you so try not to make it too ambitious or hard. No tests, so just do the work and you'll get a good grade. She's not bad on the eyes either.",

      "Awesome professor, makes this difficult class easy. Once you get over his accent you will be happy to have him as a teacher. Although his tests are somewhat difficult, you will find that the homeworks are very important for your final grade, so its not all about the tests. Highly recommend this professor.",
      "a pretty decent professor, better then the kelly guy that replaced him this semester imo. answers questions pretty well and has interesting enough lectures. his tests are almost entirely trick questions though. hope he gets well.",
      "Very difficult course and he is somewhat difficult to understand, but if you make sure you do the homework and study his slides / practice exams before the tests you will probably end up with a better grade than you thought.",
      "Extremely boring, but important class. Typical teaching style, as mentioned- he simply goes over slides. Tough teacher, but at least he's smart(though, extremely boring) and knows what he's talking about.",
      "His lectures were incredibly boring and sometimes felt completely irrelevant to the topic we were learning. His accent is not so bad, but he will put you to sleep. He's a typical professor who reads straight off lecture slides. His tests aren't too demanding, but honestly you could just read the book instead of going to class. I would avoid him.",
      "Very typical teaching style.He is a professor of slide notes. He can finish course in one lecture if university permit. Even a child turn slides without explaining. Yeah sometimes he do easy problems on slides.You are your own. Passing rate is 30%, what a great teacher.",
      "I've had profs with accents before, his isn't bad. His lectures are dull as dirt, which makes it good that he posts his typed transparencies online (he never posts handwritten ones though). Weekly HW can be hard sometimes, but his tests are killers. Even if you do study & go to lecture, he still finds ways to mess you up. Would not recommend him",
      "I got used to his accent after a while, its not that bad. The class is really interesting and will help you out a lot in your compsci career and in the future. Its a little challenging and difficult but if you put enough work into it, its really not that hard. He also curves fairly.",
      "YHe does move people if they talk but thats not really a big deal just don't talk and respect him as a teacher I thought I would hate discrete mathematics but I came to love it Go to lecture and pay attention and stop him if you dont understand because he has  tendency to go fast DO THE HOMEWORK it can help your grade a lot His accent is not thick",
      "Liked Pawagi in 110, but not so much for 215. Discrete math is not fun. I barely go to lecture because it doesn't help me understand the material.",
      "acts like he's teaching high school. if he hears you say one word he makes you move to a different seat. some people have actually walked out because of him. he loves making fun of kids, almost putting them down sometimes.",
      "This guy really knows his stuff. The lecture can get very boring and he has a thick accent. Overall he knows how to simplify the information for you. Just read his lecture slides and read the book. Also the labs are extremely easy.",
      "worst professor i've ever had!!not helpful at all!i asked him questions on midterms and final, but it seems that he did not help me anything but said u r supposed to know.really sucks!!!",
      "The worst professor i have seen so far!! horrible person doesn't know what he is talking about. He is an absolute D*****!!",
      "Best computer sciene professor ever! really knows his stuff. I have him now and I love him. His tests are ridiculously hard, I thought I failed, but he curved it to a b-. very very good prof.",
      "Professor Pawagi is a good professor.  Very approachable, and friendly if you have any questions whatsoever.  His tests are tough but if you do all the required work and put in an honest effort you'll do well.  Word of advice, dont be afraid to contact Prof. or TAs 4 help.  Definitely learned alot from this class compared to other classes here atSB",
      "The class was only okay, you get used to the accent after a while.",
      "If you have trouble understanding people with accents, do not take this class.  This professor has one of the heaviest accents ever.  If you can understand him though, you have to go to class (he knows what he is talking about).  He is always \"busy\" during office hours.",
      "Professor Pawagi is a great professor and is very helpful during his office hours. However, this was a fairly difficult intro course.  The midterm was fair, but the final was unbelievably difficult in comparison. Some of the codelab questions were also too difficult for beginners. I worked diligently, but would have liked the course to be simpler.",
      "He is good and he knows what to teach and how to. I took his class and he tries to make life easy for students and makes exam  according to the intelligence level of the class. Home works are not hard if hard questions are present they are not graded. In the beginning I could not catch up with his lectures but I could do it in as course progressed.",
      "The course material is a bit challenging and you go pretty fast, but I think Pawagi did a good job teaching it.  Exams and HW are fair.  He's pretty helpful during office hours too.  True, he has an accent that may be a little tough to swallow, but you should get used to it in time.  I certainly wouldn't mind taking another class with him.",
      "My only complaint is that his accent is a little hard to navigate, but I'm also hearing-impaired. He knows his compsci though, and he makes the stuff learnable, if not particularly easy. He's also much more open to students than most people believe; they just don't approach him enough. His tests are pretty hard though, so STUDY!",
      "CSE113 is, by nature, an incredibly hard class.  We go through a lot of material, but he handles it well and makes the class easier than it probably was in the past.  Usually available during office hours as well.  His accent takes getting used to though D:",
      "I think that most of the people who are rating him are way too hard on him.  He is very helpful and is willing to do whatever he can to help students understand the material.  Its not his fault that comp architecture and assembly language are not the most insteresting subjects.",
      "I have never had ANY problems with this professor, and had him for 2 classes. Attendance isn't even mandatory, so even if you have problems and can't work it out with him, you really don't have to go to class. Tries to be funny, so that's always a plus. Really if u study the material, u should be fine. Tests and assignments are tricky, be careful.",
      "This was my very first comp. sci. class and it wasn't bad at all. Material is pretty easy. He does a decent job going over it. Never had a problem with his accent. Homework assignments aren't very hard. Very approachable professor, helps out if you have a question on anything.",
      "He is strict about his students paying attention in class, and any disruptions will make him angry. In Fall 05 when I had him he nearly canceled a class because someone's cell phone rang twice. But his frustration is understandable since no one's phone should be going off during lecture anyway. He is a fair grader; he curves a lot on his exams.",
      "I took him for 110 and hated him since he always complain and piss at everylecture in 110. But in 220 he is nice. Hw are easy, exams have good curve and he even went to ask McKenna to push back due dates for 219 assignment when he is having an exam the same week.Still hard to understand him because of his accent.But he is much nicer compare to 110",
      "i dun understand why the easiness score is so low for him. he curves like crazy on his tests. i didnt expect to pass his class. got a 24 out of 70,a 40 out of 70, and did fairly well on the final for a B-. handed in about half the labs. good thing tashbook is teaching 110 now. but we're forced to see pawagi again for CSE220.",
